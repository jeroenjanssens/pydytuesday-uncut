I pushed the updated code.\nI added a `weight_scale` parameter that sets the interval that the uniform distribution picks values from.\nBy default `weight_scale=\"auto\"` which selects the interval based on this paper (http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/AISTATS2010_GlorotB10.pdf), depending on the activation function. It works very well compared to other initialization methods.\n\nFor `sklearn.random_projection.sparse_random_matrix`, the output matrix contains only 3 unique values, `a`, \n`-a`, and `0` which doesn't provide the asymmetry we need for weight initialization, right?\n\nRunning grid-search on the `load_digits` dataset with the following range of parameters,\n\n``` python\nparameters = {'weight_scale': np.arange(0.1, 1, 0.1),\n              'n_hidden': np.arange(50, 800, 50), 'C': [1, 10, 100, 1000]}\n```\n\nI got the following best combination,\n\n``` python\nELMClassifier(C=1, activation='tanh', algorithm='standard', batch_size=200,\n       class_weight=None, coef0=0.0, degree=3, gamma=0.0, kernel='random',\n       n_hidden=500, random_state=None, verbose=False,\n       weight_scale=0.10000000000000001)\n```\n\nThanks.\n",

Better patching the label binarizer to accept a classes argument.</B>\nAlso, it seems that `labelBinarizer` will no longer support multi-label as `multilabelbinarizer` will take its place in dealing with multi-label instances. Wouldn't that complicate things?\n\n<B>4) Since @amueller improvement in the utils module, we could the new awesome check_X_y, check_array or check_consistency_length. </B>\nI would love to use `check_X_y` but it seems the latest available 64bit  scikit-learn version does not support it yet :(?\n\n<B>5) What happens for the other kernel?</B>\nThe value of `n_hidden` does not affect other kernels at all.\n\n<B>6) What is _k?</B>\nIt is a variable given in the literature for sequential learning, I am not sure how else I could name it since it holds arbitrary information - like `H^T H`\n\n<B>7) Why not calling this solver?</B>\nWe called it `algorithm` since we handle it the same way as the `algorithm` in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3204. Also, `solver` is a keyword reserved for `ridge_regression` which we would like the user to define through the `ELM` object. (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py).\n\n<B>8) I don't find H to be particularly descriptive variable name.</B>\n`H` is the variable given in the literature - though a more descriptive name is more desirable. Should we name it `hidden_activations` instead?\n\n<B>9) The auto mode is not inline with the documentation.</B>\nI agree - I will change that :-), thanks.\n\nI addressed the remaining comments and learned new stuff about clean implementation in the process :).\nThanks!\n",

          "body": "@ndawe Thanks for the contribution - sample weights are a crucial feature of the tree module. \nI'm going to make a throughout review in the coming days - I just skimmed over the code and noticed one issue: when the sample mask is too sparse (below `min_density`) the data structures get updated (= fancy indexed via the `sample_mask` - see line 322 in tree.py). This should also apply to `sample_weight` because otherwise the weights and labels will become out-of-sync. \nWhile we check the code I'd propose to add assert statements excessively to check that the invariants hold (e.g. `sample_weight.shape[0] == y.shape[0]`).\n\nAgain, thanks for working on this feature - I really appreciate that!\n",

I agree with @glouppe that for now we should focus on getting the standard boosting solid for now. Regarding my previous comment, I do feel generic `EnsembleClassifier` and `EnsembleRegressor` classes would be convenient to have. Then you could group together arbitrary classifiers/regressors and boost them, etc. `BoostedClassifier` only requires that the `base_estimator` inherits from `ClassifierMixin` and is completely oblivious to whether it's boosting one classifier or a classifier which is a conglomerate of several. I would then suggest that `BaseEnsemble` should be stripped down to the bare essentials (basically the API of a list) and `_make_estimator`, `base_estimator`, and `n_estimators` should be moved down to a special `EnsembleGenerator` class used by random forests and boosting.\n",

      "body": "This PR proposes a new implementation for Gradient Boosting Decision Trees. This isn't meant to be a replacement of the current sklearn implementation but rather an addition.\r\n\r\nThis addresses the second bullet point from #8231.\r\n\r\nThis is a port from [pygbm](https://github.com/ogrisel/pygbm) (with @ogrisel, in Numba), which itself uses lots of the optimizations from [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM).\r\n\r\nAlgorithm details and refs\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n- The proposed algorithm roughly corresponds to the 'approximate' variant of the [XGBoost paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754), except that the data is binned at the very beginning of the training process, instead of at each node of the trees.\r\n- See also Algorithm 1 of the [LightGBM paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf).  Section 2.1 is worth a read.\r\n- For refresher or general background on GBDTs: [The elements of statistical learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/). The XGBoost paper is also pretty good.\r\n\r\nThe main differences with the current sklearn implementation are:\r\n- Before training, the data is binned into equally-spaced bins (up to 256 bins), which considerably reduces the number of split points to consider. The other advantage is that the data becomes integer-valued, which is faster to handle than real-valued data.\r\n- Newton method is used instead of gradient descent\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a lot of work to review, so please feel free to tell me if there's anything I can do / add that could ease reviewing.\r\n\r\nHere's a list of things that probably need to be discussed at some point or that are worth pointing out.\r\n\r\n- The code is a port of pygbm (from numba to cython). I've ported all the tests as well. So a huge part of the code has already been carefully reviewed (or written) by @ogrisel. There are still a few non-trivial changes to the pygbm's code, to accommodate for the numba -> cython translation.\r\n\r\n- Like #11950, this PR uses OpenMP parallelism with Cython\r\n\r\n- The code is in `sklearn/ensemble._hist_gradient_boosting` and the estimators are exposed in `sklearn.experimental` (which is created here, as a result of a discussion during the Paris sprint).\r\n\r\n- ~~`Y_DTYPE` and the associated C type for targets ``y`` is double and not float, because with float the numerical checks (`test_loss.py`) would not pass. Maybe at some point we'll want to also allow floats since using doubles uses twice as much space (which is not negligible, see the attributes of the `Splitter` class).~~ Like in LightGBM, the targets y, gains, values, and sums of gradient / hessians are doubles, and the gradients and hessians array are floats to save space (14c7d47).\r\n\r\n- I have only added a short note in the User Guide about the new estimators. I think that the gradient boosting section of the user guide could benefit from an in-depth rewriting. I'd be happy to do that, but in a later PR.\r\n\r\n- Currently the parallel code uses all possible threads. Do we want to expose `n_jobs` (openmp-wise, not joblib of course)?\r\n\r\n- The estimator names are currently `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.\r\n\r\n#### API differences with current implementation:\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss these points of course. In general I tried to match the parameters names with those of the current GBDTs.\r\n\r\n##### New features:\r\n- early stopping can be checked with an arbitrary scorer, not just with the loss\r\n- `validation_fraction` can also be an int to specify absolute size of the validation set (not just a proportion)\r\n\r\n##### Changed parameters and attributes:\r\n- the losses parameters have different names. I personally think that 'deviance' is just obfuscating for logistic loss.\r\n- the `n_estimators` parameter has been changed to `max_iter` because unlike the current GBDTs implementations, the underlying \"predictor\" aren't estimators. They are private and have no `fit` method. Also, in multiclass classification we build C * max_iter\r\n- the `estimators_` attribute has been removed for the same reason.\r\n- `train_score_` is of size `n_estimators + 1` instead of `n_estimators` because it contains the score of the 0th iteration (before the boosting process).\r\n- `oob_improvement_` is replaced by `validation_score_`, also with size `n_estimators + 1`\r\n\r\n##### Unsupported parameters and attributes:\r\n- `subsample` (doesn't really make sense here)\r\n- `criterion` (same)\r\n- `min_samples_split` is not supported, but `min_samples_leaf` is supported.\r\n- anything `samples_weights`-related\r\n- `min_impurity_decrease` is not supported (we have `min_gain_to_split` but it is not exposed in the public API)\r\n- `warm_start`\r\n- `max_features` (probably not needed)\r\n- `staged_decision_function`, `staged_predict_proba`, etc.\r\n- `init` estimator\r\n- `feature_importances_`\r\n- the `loss_` attribute is not exposed.\r\n- Only least squares loss is supported for regression. No least absolute error, huber or quantile loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Future improvement, for later PRs (no specific order):\r\n\r\n- Implement categorical variables support (what to do if there are more than 256 categories?)\r\n- Allow for more than 256 bins (requires to \"dynamically\" encode bins as uint8 or uint32)\r\n- Implement handling of missing values\r\n- Implement fast PDPs\r\n- BinMapper is doing almost the same job as KBinDiscretizer (but it's parallelized) so we could eventually integrate it.\r\n- Parallelize loss computations (should speed up early stopping when scoring=='loss')\r\n- Find a way to avoid computing predictions of all the trees when checking early stopping with a scorer. At the same time, this could avoid the `_in_fit` hackish attribute.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDone on my laptop, intel i5 7th Gen, 4 cores, 8GB Ram.\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\n- considerably faster than the current sklearn implem\r\n- faster than XGBoost ('hist' method)\r\n- faster than CatBoost (not shown here because catboost is much slower than the others and would flatten the plots)\r\n- very close to lightgbm.

Note that for larger sample sizes the current estimators simply cannot run because of the sorting step that never terminates. I don't provide the benchmark code, it's exactly the same as that of `benchmarks/bench_fast_gradient_boosting.py`:\r\n![current_vs_fast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1190450/51568253-43d4e000-1e67-11e9-9dcd-bfdd2d50e597.png)\r\n\r\n#### Comparison between proposed PR and LightGBM / XGBoost:\r\n\r\n- On the Higgs-Boson dataset:\r\n`python benchmarks/bench_hist_gradient_boosting_higgsboson.py --lightgbm --xgboost --subsample 5000000 --n-trees 50`\r\n\r\n  Sklearn: done in 28.787s, ROC AUC: 0.7330, ACC: 0.7346\r\n  LightGBM: done in 27.595s, ROC AUC: 0.7333, ACC: 0.7349\r\n  XGBoost: done in 41.726s, ROC AUC: 0.7335, ACC: 0.7351\r\n\r\n  Entire log:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/dev/sklearn(branch:gbm*) \u00bb python benchmarks/bench_hist_gradient_boosting_higgsboson.py --subsample 5000000 --n-trees 50 --lightgbm --xgboost                                    nico@cotier\r\nTraining set with 5000000 records with 28 features.\r\nFitting a sklearn model...\r\nBinning 1.120 GB of data: 3.665 s\r\nFitting gradient boosted rounds:\r\n[1/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 7, in 0.595s\r\n[2/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.602s\r\n[3/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.575s\r\n[4/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 12, in 0.552s\r\n[5/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 11, in 0.583s\r\n[6/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.578s\r\n[7/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 11, in 0.561s\r\n[8/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.524s\r\n[9/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.566s\r\n[10/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.552s\r\n[11/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 14, in 0.523s\r\n[12/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 15, in 0.538s\r\n[13/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 11, in 0.501s\r\n[14/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 12, in 0.522s\r\n[15/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.546s\r\n[16/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.409s\r\n[17/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 13, in 0.457s\r\n[18/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.520s\r\n[19/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 13, in 0.463s\r\n[20/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.399s\r\n[21/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 11, in 0.463s\r\n[22/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.356s\r\n[23/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.529s\r\n[24/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.460s\r\n[25/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.414s\r\n[26/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.516s\r\n[27/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.427s\r\n[28/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.460s\r\n[29/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 7, in 0.445s\r\n[30/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 12, in 0.535s\r\n[31/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.498s\r\n[32/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 12, in 0.521s\r\n[33/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 12, in 0.503s\r\n[34/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.410s\r\n[35/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.368s\r\n[36/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.267s\r\n[37/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.460s\r\n[38/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 11, in 0.500s\r\n[39/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.421s\r\n[40/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.391s\r\n[41/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.502s\r\n[42/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.444s\r\n[43/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 7, in 0.366s\r\n[44/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.473s\r\n[45/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 9, in 0.386s\r\n[46/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 11, in 0.411s\r\n[47/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.457s\r\n[48/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.526s\r\n[49/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 8, in 0.535s\r\n[50/50] 1 tree, 31 leaves, max depth = 10, in 0.487s\r\nFit 50 trees in 28.738 s, (1550 total leaves)\r\nTime spent finding best splits:  17.347s\r\nTime spent applying splits:      2.356s\r\nTime spent predicting:           1.428s\r\ndone in 28.787s, ROC AUC: 0.7330, ACC: 0.7346\r\nFitting a LightGBM model...\r\n[LightGBM] [Warning] min_sum_hessian_in_leaf is set=0.001, min_child_weight=0.001 will be ignored.

First, add the following to the top of `splitting.pyx`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# cython: profile=True\r\n# cython: linetrace=True\r\n# cython: binding=True\r\n# distutils: define_macros=CYTHON_TRACE_NOGIL=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen wrap `self.splitter.split_indicies` (in `TreeGrower`) with `profile = line_profiler.LineProfiler(self.splitter.split_indices)` and call the function: `profile.runcall(self.splitter.split_indices, node.split_info, node.sample_indices)`, we can run line profiling on `split_indices`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLine #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents\r\n==============================================================\r\n   280                                                   cdef:\r\n   281         1          3.0      3.0      0.0              int n_samples = sample_indices.shape[0]\r\n   282                                                       const X_BINNED_DTYPE_C [::1] X_binned = \\\r\n   283         1          2.0      2.0      0.0                  self.X_binned[:, split_info.feature_idx]\r\n   284         1          1.0      1.0      0.0              unsigned int [::1] left_indices_buffer = self.left_indices_buffer\r\n   285         1          0.0      0.0      0.0              unsigned int [::1] right_indices_buffer = self.right_indices_buffer\r\n   286         1          1.0      1.0      0.0              int n_threads = omp_get_max_threads()\r\n   287         2         52.0     26.0      0.0              int [:] sizes = np.full(n_threads, n_samples // n_threads,\r\n   288         1          4.0      4.0      0.0                                      dtype=np.int32)\r\n   289         1         13.0     13.0      0.0              int [:] offset_in_buffers = np.zeros(n_threads, dtype=np.int32)\r\n   290         1          9.0      9.0      0.0              int [:] left_counts = np.empty(n_threads, dtype=np.int32)\r\n   291         1          8.0      8.0      0.0              int [:] right_counts = np.empty(n_threads, dtype=np.int32)\r\n   292                                                       int left_count\r\n   293                                                       int right_count\r\n   294                                                       int start\r\n   295                                                       int stop\r\n   296                                                       int i\r\n   297                                                       int thread_idx\r\n   298                                                       int sample_idx\r\n   299                                                       int right_child_position\r\n   300         1          9.0      9.0      0.0              int [:] left_offset = np.zeros(n_threads, dtype=np.int32)\r\n   301         1          7.0      7.0      0.0              int [:] right_offset = np.zeros(n_threads, dtype=np.int32)\r\n   302                                           \r\n   303         2          1.0      0.5      0.0          with nogil:\r\n   304         1          0.0      0.0      0.0              for thread_idx in range(n_samples % n_threads):\r\n   305                                                           sizes[thread_idx] += 1\r\n   306                                           \r\n   307         1          0.0      0.0      0.0              for thread_idx in range(1, n_threads):\r\n   308         3          1.0      0.3      0.0                  offset_in_buffers[thread_idx] = \\\r\n   309         3          1.0      0.3      0.0                      offset_in_buffers[thread_idx -

When you compare its execution time with lightgbm (see https://github.com/ogrisel/pygbm/issues/30#issuecomment-435049478 to activate more detailed output), you'll see that we have the same (sometimes even better) splitting time as lightgbm:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsklearn:\r\n\r\nTime spent finding best splits:  26.843s\r\nTime spent applying splits:      4.077s\r\nTime spent predicting:           2.790s\r\nscore: 0.9574\r\nfit duration: 43.575s,\r\nscore duration: 1.874s,\r\n\r\nlightgbm:\r\n[LightGBM] [Info] SerialTreeLearner::init_train costs 0.279268\r\n[LightGBM] [Info] SerialTreeLearner::init_split costs 0.001121\r\n[LightGBM] [Info] SerialTreeLearner::hist_build costs 22.576566\r\n[LightGBM] [Info] SerialTreeLearner::find_split costs 0.178835\r\n[LightGBM] [Info] SerialTreeLearner::split costs 4.170067\r\nscore: 0.9574\r\nfit duration: 38.538s,\r\nscore duration: 2.373s,\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Time spent finding best splits` corresponds to `SerialTreeLearner::hist_build costs + SerialTreeLearner::find_split costs` and this is clearly where the main difference comes from.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUnless I missed something really obvious, we already have parallelized all what's possible, and implemented all the lightgbm optimizations I could find. If there must be a breakthrough it's probably going to be about data structures, some magic Cython optimization / interaction, and maybe the histogram computation.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I personally don't think that optimizing the code should be our primary focus here. I've been doing this for months now, and with @ogrisel we have made pygbm twice as fast as it once was, but I'm starting to reach a limit here and progress is probably going to be very slow. I believe it's fast enough as-is so I'd prefer review about how to get this merged but of course feel free to try",

Lightgbm uses floats for gradient and hessians, and doubles for `y`, gains, values, etc. I'll try something similar and will report.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nDone in  14c7d47, should work OK!\r\nIt might even have sped things up a little",

          "body": "Additional problem that we encountered:\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (since the original PR was made), Transformers need 2D `X` values. Therefore, I made sure in the ColumnTransformer that I always pass through the subset of columns to the transformer as a 2D object, also when you apply the transformer only on a single column.\r\n\r\nBut, by ensuring this, the example using a `TfidfVectorizer` fails, because that one expects a 1D object of text samples. \r\n\r\nSo possible options:\r\n\r\n1.  Add a way to specify in the `ColumnTransformer` that for certain transformers the passed X values should be kept as 1D. \r\n  E.g. we could have\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ColumnTransformer([('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer, 'text_col'), ...],\r\n                      flatten_column={'tfidf': True})`\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    where `flatten_column` (or other name like `keep_1d`) is False by default (satisfying the normal Transformers), but you can specify per transformer if you want to override this default of False. \r\n  The use of  a dict here is similar to the `transformer_weights` keyword.\r\n\r\n2. Adapt the example (which means: letting the user write more boilerplate) to fix it, eg by adding a step in the pipeline to select the single column from the 2D object.  \r\n  We could add one line to the current pipeline that holds the TFIDF (this tuple is one of the transformers in the ColumnTransformer) \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n            # Pipeline for standard bag-of-words model for body\r\n            ('body_bow', Pipeline([\r\n    added -->   ('flatten', FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x[:, 0], validate=False)),\r\n                ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()),\r\n                ('best', TruncatedSVD(n_components=50)),\r\n            ]), 'body'),\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Adapt `TfidfVectorizer` to eg have a keyword that allows to specify that 2D data is expected (which would be False by default for backwards compatibility).  \r\n  If we would like to do this one, this might ideally be a separate PR and so the second option can be used as a temporary hack to the example to have it working and which can be removed in the other PR.",

Explain your changes.\r\nHi! This is an implementation of the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor algorithm that follows the original implementation of the author's (K.Weinberger) Matlab code (see also my docstrings). As far as I know there is no prior implementation of this version of the algorithm in python and no version at all in scikit-learn. The implementation lies in a single file (sklearn/neighbors/lmnn.py). Maybe it should go directly in the sklearn/neighbors/classification.py but I thought it would make things too cluttered. It is basically a subclass of the `KNeighborsClassifier` with a lot of added functionality. I put also an example in examples/neighbors/plot_lmnn_classification.py that is basically a copy of the simple nearest neighbor example in examples/neighbors/plot_classification.py. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nI run all scikit-learn tests I could find and it now passes all of them. There is still a TODO in the code which I think is a minor issue (the algorithm works anyway). Somehow during fitting, I need to pass a possibly changed attribute (n_neighbors) to the superclass and call the fit method of the superclass. I would appreciate any comments and/or help to finalize this. Thanks!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

Solving in M leads to a convex problem but\n> requires projection steps onto the PSD cone (which is rather fast unless\n> the dimension is large), while solving in L is typically faster and allows\n> to choose the output dimension at the price of nonconvexity. Solving in L\n> thus seems like a good choice but it may be good to run a few experiments\n> to check whether local optima can be an issue when initializing to the\n> identity matrix (definitely one should not initialize to the zero matrix as\n> this is a local optimum! maybe worth pointing out somewhere).\n> 4/ The total number of impostors scales like O(n^2) where n is the size of\n> the dataset. Hence the impostors computation will be the bottleneck on\n> large datasets. Note that most of the corresponding losses are always zero\n> during the course of the optimization because most impostors are very far\n> away in the original space. A former implementation by the authors used a\n> working set strategy (working with a subset of violated constraints which\n> is updated every now and then). You could consider something similar (not\n> recomputing all impostors at each iteration for instance). Another typical\n> workaround is to solve a problem with less impostors by considering a fixed\n> number p of impostors for each point (the p closest differently labeled\n> point in Euclidean distance). It introduces an additional parameter but\n> allows more scalability (and often does not change the solution much if p\n> is large enough).\n> 5/ Generally I would like to see an example of this running on a larger\n> dataset than iris. A possible candidate is the good old MNIST (possibly\n> after PCA) which, as you may guess, has been used extensively in metric\n> learning papers. You could also benchmark the performance with the\n> implementation from the metric-learn package referred above (which from\n> what I can remember does not scale very well).\n>\n> Apologies for the long message!\n> ------------------------------\n>\n> In sklearn/neighbors/lmnn.py\n> <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/8602#discussion_r113727520>\n> :\n>\n> > +\n> +        # Check training data\n> +        X, y = check_X_y(X, y, ensure_min_samples=2)\n> +        check_classification_targets(y)\n> +\n> +        # Store the appearing classes and the class index for each sample\n> +        classes, y_inversed = np.unique(y, return_inverse=True)\n> +\n> +        # Check number of classes > 1\n> +        n_classes = len(classes)\n> +        if n_classes < 2:\n> +            raise ValueError(\"LargeMarginNearestNeighbor requires 2 or more \"\n> +                             \"distinct classes, got {}.\".format(n_classes))\n> +\n> +        # Check every class has at least 2 samples\n> +        min_class_size = bincount(y_inversed).min()\n>\n> Instead of throwing an error, it would probably be better to simply ignore\n> singleton classes when fitting LMNN (but still use them subsequently for\n> KNN).

          "body": "Hi @bellet , thanks for the comments. I agree with most of these points. Specifically:\r\n1) I added this to the docs. \r\n2) I have done this in the past and the results were more or less the same. I'm running the experiments again. It seems with small deviations, accuracy is the same or even a bit better. Only on MNIST unfortunately, I get a larger test error. I get 2.0% +- 0.1% with different number of iterations and number of principal components in the preprocessing) while with the Matlab code I get 1.73% (as reported in the journal paper). I'm not sure why that's the case. It might lie in the L-BFGS implementation (Mark Schmidt's `minFunc` in Matlab is pretty good).\r\n3) This is exactly where the implementation differs from the original algorithm formulation. The authors say (I have also observed) that the algorithm usually avoids local minima. Also the default setting is to initialize with the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, rather than the identity. \r\n4) That's true. I have followed the current implementation by the authors. I could try the working set strategy, but that is going to take some time to implement. \r\nInstead of a `p` parameter per point, there is currently a `max_constraints` parameter with which one can somewhat reduce the runtime at the price of not enforcing all constraints. \r\n5) See point 2. \r\n\r\n**Update:** I replaced my PCA initialization with sklearn's PCA, that uses SVD and I got 1.84% test error on MNIST. It seems that the eigenvectors computed from Lapack's `dgesdd` are different from the ones from the routines `_syevd`, `_heevd` that I used before (by eigendecomposing the covariance matrix). Still I guess there must be some room for improvement until 1.73%.",

          "body": "Looking forward to this addition!\r\n\r\n>> Generally I would like to see an example of this running on a larger dataset than iris. A possible candidate is the good old MNIST (possibly after PCA) which, as you may guess, has been used extensively in metric learning papers. You could also benchmark the performance with the implementation from the metric-learn package referred above (which from what I can remember does not scale very well).\r\n\r\nHere is  [a benchmark for LMNN on MNIST data](https://github.com/rth/notebooks/blob/master/benchmark/mnist_pca_lmnn_sklearn_benchmark.ipynb) with PCA. \r\n\r\nI can confirm that this implementation scales much better than the one in metric-learn: in this benchmark the scaling appears to be `~O(n_samples**1.5)` while it is of `~ O(n_samples**1.8)` for the pure python LMNN implementation from metric-learn (e.g. for `n_samples=1000` the former is ~7x faster) .  Memory usage is also much lower.\r\n\r\n> Only on MNIST unfortunately, I get a larger test error. I get 2.0% +- 0.1% with different number of iterations and number of principal components in the preprocessing) while with the Matlab code I get 1.73% (as reported in the journal paper)\r\n\r\nI also get a similar accuracy of 0.977 in this benchmark with 50 PCA components. The thing is though that is almost no improvement over the  regular `KNeighborsClassifier` in this case, which gets an accuracy of 0.975.  I also get no improvement on the iris dataset (without PCA). \r\n\r\nAn example that illustrates that `LargeMarginNearestNeighbor` can outperform `KNeighborsClassifier`  would be useful, I think (using some small dataset that is faster to compute than MNIST).\r\n\r\nImplementation wise,  it might be better to remove the `pairs_distances_batch` function from this PR and use the standard `parwise_distances` function. That would give all the more incentive for merging https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7979). Unless this implementation would use much more memory, without the batched pairwise distance, than the regular  `KNeighborsClassifier`  ?",

I will also upload a notebook in the coming days. \r\nAbout the `pairs_distances_batch` function, it's not the same as `pairwise_distances` I think. It is actually computing an n-dimensional vector of distances between two n by d matrices - call them X and Y - namely the distances between rows X[i] and Y[i] for all i. I think `row_norms` is the closest I have found but it does not have a batch size option. `pairwise_distances` computes an n by n matrix, namely all distance pairs between rows of X and Y.",

When people use multiple metric then they should definitely be expected to check the docstring to know how the scores for different metrics will be returned... correct?\n\nCan I suggest that we leave `cross_val_score` as such (without implementing multiple metric there) and let it remain as a quick easy way to cross-validate for single metric and like Joel suggested `cross_validate` which will return a dict like `cv_result_`? There we can easily support multiple metric...\n",

          "body": "OK, some general comments:\n- Your tests should include a working example in the Neighbours framework (i.e. create a classifier and test it can be called). This checks that the API is correct.\n- You did reduce your testing size, but can you reduce even more? i.e. you are only testing for accuracy, is there any damage to having `samples=5` and `dim=2`?\n- `LSHForest.fit(self, X=None)` has X=None as a default value, but this fails (as it should). Don't let X=None, make it required.\n- Please create a usage example (see the examples/ folder) based on your previous blog posts. See [this example](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_mini_batch_kmeans.html), which shows something similar to what you might want to show (although you may want to show speed improvement too). Examples can take (much) longer than tests to run, so feel free to use a larger dataset.\n- Narrative documentation! see doc/modules\n\nAt this point, I'd be happy to go to the scikit-learn devs to get further comments.\n",

An MLP consists of multiple layers, usually of one hidden layer, an input layer and an output layer, where each layer is fully connected to the next one. This is a classic algorithm that has been extensively used in Neural Networks.\n\n<h3>Code Check out :</h3>\n\n1) git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn\n2) cd scikit-learn/\n3) git fetch origin refs/pull/2120/head:mlp\n4) git checkout mlp \n\n<h3>Tutorial link:</h3>\n- http://easymachinelearning.blogspot.com/p/multi-layer-perceptron-tutorial.html\n\n<h3>Sample Benchmark:</h3>\n- `MLP` on the scikit's `Digits` dataset gives,\n  - Score for `tanh-based sgd`: 0.981\n  -  Score for `logistic-based sgd`: 0.987\n  -  Score for `tanh-based l-bfgs`: 0.994\n  -  Score for `logistic-based l-bfgs`: 1.000\n\n<h3>TODO:</h3>\n- Review\n",

          "body": "1) @amueller, larsmans missing part was the backpropagation which was partly developed in Cython, I developed that part using vectorized matrix operations, its quite fast, for example, running the algorithm on the 'digits' dataset for 400 iterations with 50 hidden neurons, would take about 5 seconds. I also added the option of using of a secondary optimization algorithm 'fmin_l_bfgs_bf' which is as fast, but achieves better classification performance with the same number of iterations. I'm also thinking of adding a third option: 'fmin_cg'. These optimizers are somewhat heavily used in neural networks.\n\nI read that Cython code is easy to produce (just a matter of adding some prefixes and compiling the code). I will Cython the code and see if it adds benefits.\n\n2) Yes. It supports sparse matrices (via safe_sparse_dot)\n\nThanks for the review\n",

I had a weird benchmark that made me think that `X.T` improved performance, but in reality it did not, so I removed the transpose, making the code cleaner and easier to debug while the performance unchanged.\n\nMoreover, I just  committed a lot of changes, including, \n- Optimization_method parameter for selecting any scipy optimizer\n- Support of SGD \n- Improved minibatch creation using scikit's gen_even_slices\n  - (much faster than `X[inds[minibatch::n_batches]]`)\n- Support of loss functions `cross-entropy` and `square` (more will be added)\n- Typos and name fixes\n\nThe performance benchmark on the `digits` dataset  (100 hidden neurons and 170 iterations),\n- SGD with `cross-entropy` loss \n  - Score : 0.95\n- Optimization using `CG` aka `Congruent Gradient` with `cross-entropy` loss \n  - Score : 0.95\n- Optimization using `l-bfgs` with `square` loss\n  - Score  : 0.98 (it has converged in 80 iterations)\n- Please note that the score is worse when the loss is `square` for `SGD` and `CG`.\n\nWill post the test results on the `20News` dataset soon.\n\nSome of the remaining TODO's would be:\n- Use `sqrt(n_features)` to select the number of hidden neurons\n- Update the documentation\n- Add verbose\n- Add a test file\n- Add an example file\n\nThank you for your great reviews!\n",

I suspect a bug in computing the `deltas` (line `454` to `466`) that lead to these obscure results. I'll use the unit test to ensure the backpropagation is working as necessary.\n\nThe documentation will be updated once the code is deemed reliable.\n\nThank you for your great reviews and tips! :)\n",

As `tanh` can yield negative values, applying the `log` function on that produces an error, so I added code that scales the value in [0,1] range to ensure it being positive via `0.5*(a_output + 1)`\n\nThe code seems to be accepted by the travis build, however, MLPRegressor is yet to be implemented, but will be done soon.\n\nPS: I'm also writing a blog that aims in helping 'newcomers to the field' (maybe practitionars even) engage in Neural Networks\nhttp://easydeeplearning.blogspot.com/p/multi-layer-perceptron-tutorial.html\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

          "body": "Okay done :), I have fixed the binary classification, I'm getting 100% score with `logistic` as well as `tanh`  on a binary dataset generated using the `Digits`  scikit's repository. It turns out that I had to apply `logistic` on the output layer regardless of the activation function in the hidden layer, and the loss function is \n`-np.mean(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))`\n\nGladly, it passed the travis test, now what is left is to re-use some of scikit's cython-based loss functions (and logistic) for improved speed and implement MLP for regression.\n\nIn addition, the packing and unpacking methods are to be improved.\n",

Can these 2 classes be collapsed into one? Less levels of indirection make it easier to profile and optimize. It also makes simpler Cython code.\n\nWhat is the best way to store the data structures? We have here lists of objects, that have attributes that store the interesting information. Can we have lists / arrays of these interesting info? (unlikely, but worth thinking).\n\nTo think about that, I would make a diagram with all the data-structures layed out, and what they contribute to the algorithm.\n",

Yes, `partial_fit` (or `partial_fit_predict`?) support would be wonderful, but I'm not sure that the current solution of storing labels for every training instance makes sense in a large-scale clustering approach. A `fit`-`predict` paradigm could make more sense, or could be provided as an option (and this means you don't need to track `sample_indices_`, but have an additional `O(nlogn)` predict time.\n2. The paper describes a global clustering step in which an arbitrary clustering algorithm is applied to the identified subclusters. It seems this is not presently included. Is it possible to provide a meta-estimator or some other kind of data reduction transformation that allows subcluster centroids to then be clustered and those global-cluster labels returned from `predict` for the subcluster nearest each sample? (Note also that BIRCH is coming very close to some of the instance reduction techniques that have been mooted on the ML.)\n3. Does adding `__slots__` to every `CFNode`/`CFSubcluster` improve its profile?\n4. I have thought about how to represent this, and it is not really very numpy friendly, in that I don't see a clean way for arrays to be used to represent the node space. Without tracking `sample_indices_` (as above), it may be possible to have `CFNode.subcluters_` as an array and hence vectorize the update step.\n",

All of these are aliases / special cases of `sklearn.linear_models._glm.GeneralizedLinearRegressor` which is currently not exposed to address concerns in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9405. The more I use this the more I think that maybe we should expose it, as it's matches closely with the theoretical GLM formulation and it's more natural to do `GeneralizedLinearRegressor(family='inverse.gaussian')` (or something similar) than `TweedieRegressor(power=3)`. That's for instance [Spark MLlib did](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-classification-regression.html#generalized-linear-regression). Though we could re-visit this later to make this PR less controversial.",

If we just expose `GeneralizedLinearRegressor`, the distribution must be specified with `family=...`, ideally with a string or a number. How can one then select one distribution that needs an additional parameter like `TweedieDistribution(power=1)`? So far, we have only implemented Tweedie distributions, so `TweedieRegressor(power=...)` seems enough and doesn't need `family`.\r\nIf you decide that Tweedie distributions are the only ones supported here, we are fine with the above. Nevertheless, I predict new issues longing for new distributions like the negative binomial distribution. Just saying this to be prepared - I'm fine with only Tweedie right now.",

Additionally, we can pass a cost/gain-matrix that could be used to optimize a business metric. For this case, we are limited to constant cost/gain. In the future, we can think of cost/gain that depends on the matrix `X` but we would need to be able to forward meta-data to the scorer (a good additional use case for SLEP006 @adrinjalali).\r\n\r\n**`cv` and `refit`**: we provide some flexibility to pass refitted model and single train/test split. We add limitations and documentation to caveats with an example.\r\n\r\n### Point to discuss\r\n\r\n- Are we fine with the name `TunedThresholdClassifier`? Shall instead have something about \"threshold\" (e.g. `ThresholdTuner`)?\r\n- We are using the term `objective_metric`, `constraint_value` and `objective_score`. Is the naming fine? An alternative to \"objective\" might be \"utility\"?\r\n\r\n### Further work\r\n\r\nI implemented currently a single example that shows the feature in the context of post-tuning of the decision threshold.\r\n\r\nThe current example is using a single train/test split for the figure and I think it would be nice to have some ROC/precision-recall curve obtained from cross-validation to be complete. However, we need some new features to be implemented.\r\n\r\nI also am planning to analyse the usage of this feature on the problem of calibration on imbalanced classification problems. The feeling on this topic is that resampling strategies involved an implicit tuning of the decision threshold at the cost of a badly calibrated model. It might be better to learn a model on the imbalanced problem directly, making sure that it is well calibrated and then post-tune the decision threshold for \"hard\" prediction. In this case, you get the best of two worlds: a calibrated model if the output of `predict_proba` is important to you and an optimum hard predictor for your specific utility metric. However, this is going to need some investigation and will be better suited for another PR.",

          "body": "@glemaitre Thank you very much for this (extensive! due to examples, I see) PR.\r\n\r\nTo let you know my current point of view, let us focus on binary classification. First of all, **YES** we urgently need tools for threshold selection and make it prominent.\r\nI even have been considering to write a SLEP to add a `threshold` parameter to all classifiers, at least the ones with `predict_proba` because the implicit 0.5 has so many consequences of bad practice. I see 3 steps:\r\n1. Add possibility to manual set a threshold. This is really important in my opinion.\r\n   In particular for binary classification, the cost ratio parameter **is** the optimal threshold. And there might be cases where the different costs for false positives and false negatives are known.\r\n3. Add tools for automatic threshold selection (given a fitted model). This is a 1-dimensional optimization problem, so we could just use `scipy.optimize`. BTW, the ROC curve was invented for exactly this...\r\n4. Add CV-tools for automatic threshold selection.\r\n\r\nThis PR immediately starts with point 3 and that is my main concern.\r\n\r\nConsider the use case: Assume I have a good model for `predict_proba` (maybe found via cv), now that is fixed. I apply that model in my application, and I choose a threshold for decisions/actions. By tracking the performance, I observe a certain shift of my KPIs. The first thing I can do is to tweak the threshold a bit, but let the model otherwise be untouched (no new training data, or too expensive to re-train, or etc.).\r\n",

For multiclass settings, this gets promoted to a matrix (with some redundancy), see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08979 for 3 classes. I'm undecided whether users and maintainers could be convinced to appreciate such parameters via `ClassifierMixin`. I still think it would be the cleanest solution, otherwise `predict` is just nonsense without being noted.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it is hard to decide on a good name for the current meta-estimator, e.g. include CV at the end of the name or not, is a sign, IMHO, that it tries to do too many things at once.\r\n\r\nIf we go with it, `ClassificationThresholdTunerCV` might indeed be the correct name. (BTW, `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` has the exact same name length.)\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me wrong: Great work @glemaitre, I really appreciate this PR!",

Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe contribution guidelines: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Contributing-Pull-Requests\r\n-->\r\n#### Reference Issue\r\n<!-- Example: Fixes #1234 -->\r\nFixes #2989\r\nModifies and closes #4844\r\nBuilds upon #9348 \r\n\r\nThis PR implements a k-Nearest Neighbor based missing data imputation algorithm. The algorithm is based on the one proposed in **Olga  Troyanskaya,  Michael  Cantor,  Gavin  Sherlock,  Pat  Brown,  Trevor  Hastie,  Robert  Tibshirani, David Botstein and Russ B. Altman, Missing value estimation methods for DNA microarrays, BIOINFORMATICS Vol. 17 no. 6, 2001 Pages 520-525** and implemented in the R-package **[Impute](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/impute/man/impute.pdf)** from Bioconductor.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm uses euclidean distance to calculate the k nearest neighbors of the data point with one or more missing coordinate(s). The mean coordinate value of the neighbors is then used to impute the missing coordinate value. The algorithm can also handle missing value in the neighbors if they have missing in either the same coordinate or other coordinates. While calculating the euclidean distance, it zero-weights coordinates with missing value in either vector in the pair and up-weights the remaining coordinates. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nAs things stand, the imputation procedure runs fine ~~if the matrix passed in fit() and transform() are the same, which is probably the vast majority of use cases. I am working on making it work when two different matrices are passed to the two methods. It should not be too much work and I am hoping to finish this soon.~~ Further, this implementation currently only works with dense matrices, and it would be really awesome if somebody could take up the sparse matrix case (please let us know if you do, so that there is no duplication of effort).\r\n\r\nPS: This is my first ever submission to Scikit Learn,  so please forgive me for the numerous silly and/or frustrating things you are bound to bump into while you examine the code :)\r\n\r\n**Task List**\r\n- [x] Resolve issue of euclidean distance calculation with NaN values \r\n- [x] Get kNN imputation working\r\n- [x] Fix issue with passing separate matrices in fit() and transform()\r\n- [x] Add weighted imputation\r\n- [x] Add documentation\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [x] Add examples\r\n\r\n### NOTE:\r\nFor those folks who would like to use KNNImputer in the meantime, I have released it as a separate package called [missingpy](https://github.com/epsilon-machine/missingpy). ~~That package will be kept up-to-date with any changes to this branch.~~ (Some of the newer changes might not be carried over but that does not affect the core imputation algorithm, which is ready for use).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value\r\nall user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to\r\nreview, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,\r\nconvincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either\r\ncase, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\nFor more information, see our FAQ on this topic:\r\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/dev/faq.html#why-is-my-pull-request-not-getting-any-attention.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n",

          "body": "Thanks for the PR. I'm not that familiar with OPTICS myself, but I had a look through.\nBefore getting too in depth, coding style wise you should make you code [pep8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Few minor things I mentioned from first glance are also mentioned in comments..\n\nThe other thing I'll mention, is that the scikit-learn generally follows [this API style](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects).. \nIt'd be good if you can make your API match that of the scikit, like making\n`prep_optics(...), build_optics(...), ExtractDBSCAN(...)` ect. match the 'fit(..)' ect. API. Other help functions you can keep as is. \n\nHope that helps for now. Thanks again :+1: \n",

          "body": "@michaelaye : Good question. This had fallen off my radar a bit, but I just pushed a fairly large update, the main purpose of which was to fit in with the scikit-learn API; documentation has been increased as well. I believe that fit within the sklearn API was the previous main issue.\n\nThe code is pep 8 with the exception of a single long line, which is hard to re-write without losing readability. The algorithm has been tested on points in three dimensions up to order 10^8 with no ill effects (~40 hours on my 4 year old laptop), and memory use is small. I know scikit-learn doesn\u2019t have an OPTICS implementation, so I\u2019d like to see it included and am happy to work with the maintainers if there are any outstanding issues.\n\nWhile the API is as close as possible to sklearn, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a natural way to \u2018rescan\u2019 for a different eps distance. The sklearn methods fit, predict, and transform all expect data as an input, and the whole point of OPTICS is that you don\u2019t need to recompute anything for a lower eps after the first run\u2026so there isn\u2019t really a sklearn-ish way to implement that\u2014 I\u2019ve included an \u2018extract\u2019 method that takes a new eps distance and nothing else to do this.\n\nI think that there are additional things that could be done to enhance the module, specifically a save and restore function for dealing with large datasets where you want persistence beyond a single python session, and also some additional performance tweaks. That said, this algorithm doesn\u2019t currently exist in sklearn, and it works and matches the sklearn API fairly well. It is also, due to aggressive pruning, several orders of magnitude faster than other implementations that I\u2019ve seen.\n",

          "body": "@espg For persistence, that is basically automatic with pickling. The estimator should be pickle-able (there is actually a test for that afaik), and if not that should be fixed.\n\nFor the benchmarks: The results are supposed to be comparable to DBSCAN, right? So I think a performance comparison against DBSCAN, showing how it is more scalable, would be great (or showing that with the current dbscan impl the memory would blow up).\n\nFor rescanning: Maybe @GaelVaroquaux can say a word about how he solve a similar problem with agglomerative approaches. My first idea would be to have some attribute that stores the whole hierarchical structure which could be accessed by the user. That is obviously not super convenient.\n\nThere are also tests missing, for clustering usually some sanity tests on synthetic data and maybe some that are specific to the algorithm. I can't really say much about that as I am not super familiar with the algorithm. Usually we want near-complete line-coverage, though.\n\nFor the Documentation, we also want narrative documentation (at `doc/modules/clustering.rst`).\nThat could describe what is similar or different from other clustering approaches in scikit-learn, roughly the intuition of the parameters,  the idea of the algorithm, and when it is particularly usefull (like this is a memory-limited variant of dbscan that produces a hierarchical clustering or something).\n\nMaybe also add it to the clustering comparison example.\n",

          "body": "@amueller : Thank you for the directions on where this needs to go. The tests are a bit of hangup, really I need to write a different example/test that is specific to OPTICS that is appropriate for showing multiple hierarchies of clusters for extracting at different eps values. Right now, I've just been using the same example that DBSCAN uses; however, the automated unit test for clustering fail for the following reason:\n\nThe OPTICS algorithm struggles with cases where the extracted clustering structure is close to the **initial** eps value (really, close to eps_max). In otherwords, running `OPTICS(eps=.3,min_samples=10).fit(X)` gives different (and incorrect) clustering compared to:\n\n```\nclust = OPTICS(eps=3.0,min_samples=10)\nclust.fit(X)\nclust.extract(0.3)\n```\n\n...which matches the results given from DBSCAN.\n\nThis is because the cluster seeds, which are expanded, are sensitive to starting location for low eps values. Using an eps value of inf ensures that you always get the same results as DBSCAN, but for large point sets gives a pretty substantial slow down; it is worth having the parameter user specified, but it needs to be larger than the final extraction-- somewhere between 5 and 10 times the largest eps value that you plan to cluster at. This could be scaled automatically in the init and fit options, but I think that approach is contrary to the API style for contributing; so I'm guessing that the appropriate use of the parameter needs to be explained in a narrative documentation page?\n",

I just went ahead and implemented this. We could remove if you feel this is superfluous and confuses `search_results_`.\n\nRefer the 2nd cell of the [sandbox notebook](https://github.com/rvraghav93/multiple_metric_grid_search_sandbox/blob/674f4c52195b2ce0f407363c439d7d8c2c7db44d/multiple_metric_grid_search_sandbox.ipynb) for a sample usage.

'col1': a[:,1]}\n>>> # Changing here changes at a too\n>>> # confirming that it is a view and not a copy\n>>> d['col1'][0] = 5\n>>> print(a[0, 1])\n5\n```\n\nThis way we will have a list of dict (of candidates) for non-pandas users and dict of masked arrays for pandas users and raw 2D score arrays for hardcore users ;)\n\nOr should we not worry about non-pandas users wanting something similar to our old `grid_scores_` and proceed with making this PR better?\n",

I have a question, though: it seems that None in a scalar dimension is transformed to \"NaN\" and causes all the distances to this observation to be \"nan\". Is this a bug or a feature? Or am I missing something here? I will analyze the code some more but maybe you already have an answer ready at hand ...",

Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe contribution guidelines: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## \u26a0 This PR has been superseded by https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21462\r\n\r\n### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nAggregations over pairwise distances (argmin, argkmin, threshold filtering, cumulative sum, etc.) are one of the foundations used by many algorithms within scikit-learn.\r\n\r\nVarious strategies exist to compute them different, including some using chunks (see [`sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/95afec874271a46211914037390974f27aa233f7/sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py)). However, those are still mainly implemented at the level of Python leaving some rooms for man\u0153uvre, especially for potential optimizations which can be made at a lower level.\r\n\r\nThis PR explores new implementations for such aggregations using Cython to have a finer control over computations (similarly to what has been explored and implemented for K-means).\r\n\r\nImportantly, the core of the computation is **chunked to make sure that the pairwise distance chunk matrices stay in CPU cache** before applying the final reduction step. This can lead to several x speed-ups alone. Furthermore, the chunking strategy is also used to leverage **OpenMP-based paralellism** (using Cython `prange` loop) which gives another multiplicative speed-up in favorable cases on many-core machines.\r\n\r\n### Interfaces benefiting from this PR\r\n\r\nCore interfaces:\r\n - `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`\r\n - `sklearn.neighbors.RadiusNeighborsMixin.radius_neighbors`\r\n

INCREASED.\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nThe initial experiments have been in [`scikit-learn-inria-fondation/pdist_aggregation`](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/pdist_aggregation/)\r\n\r\nSubsequent work include:\r\n - the adaptation for sparse datasets implementations by @mbatoul is still WIP in https://github.com/jjerphan/scikit-learn/pull/4\r\n - the adaptation using optimized interfaces of algorithms internals such as:\r\n   - [cluster._optics._compute_core_distances_](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/786c4e5e39648127f41913d4e0c53672a44306f0/sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L362)\r\n   - setting `return_distance=False` where applicable on `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` and `sklearn.neighbors.RadiusNeighborsMixin.radius_neighbors` calls.\r\n   - specialize `ArgKmin(k=1)` under `ArgMin`\r\n   - define `PairwiseDistancesReduction` for `KMeans` and adapt its implementation accordingly\r\n   - row norms of `X_train` once and attach it to `KNeighborsMixin`s\r\n - compare OpenMP scheduling strategies (especially `'static'` vs `'guided'`)  \r\n---\r\n\r\n### Main changes:\r\n - [x] Group `NeighborsHeap` implementations in a private submodule and factor code from `neighbors._binary_tree.NeighborsHeap` as it is being reused here\r\n - [x] Move `DistanceMetrics` from `neighbors` to `metrics` and unify types\r\n - [x] Introduce a backward compatibility alias with a deprecation warning for `sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetrics` because unfortunately [it's part of the public API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric.html) of scikit-learn.\r\n - [x] Introduce the `'fast_sqeuclidean'` strategy (the current one using the `_gemm` trick) and document it appropriately (tl;dr fast, but unstable when far from the origin)\r\n - [x] Adapt `pairwise_distances_argmin_min`\r\n - [x] Introduce general class hierarchy for reductions on pairwise distance\r\n - [x] Implement a reduction for querying neighbors using a radius (similarly to [`RadiusNeighborsMixin._radius_neighbors_reduce_func`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/d386fe11a58ae910e988a17c02276964b917bce1/sklearn/neighbors/_base.py#L926))\r\n - [x] Add tests for the private submodule\r\n - [x] Add a guard on arm64 to use the latest version of openblas and use it in CI\r\n - [x] Use `metric=\"fast_sqeuclidean\"` in `KNeighborsClassifier`/`Regressor` by default to unlock maximum prediction performance while give the users full control to use a more numerically stable alternative otherwise.\r\n - [x] Support sparse matrices (sparse-dense, dense-sparse, sparse-sparse) Design (see `DatasetsPair`)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very

Having a global summary will help comparing runs as well as the new implementations' evolution.\r\n\r\nI am glad that we can add both a general template, `PairwiseDistancesReduction`, allowing supporting various distances and reductions (argkmin, radius-based neighborhood) and still have good (even better\u203d) performances.\r\n\r\nThose new implementations got their interactions with datastructures reworked (e.g the synchronization for the parallelisation on Y was removed) which might help explain those results.\r\n\r\nIn that regards, I think the heuristic should be calibrated again at the end of this PR and potentially tuned for each type of reduction (`ArgKmin`, `RadiusNeighborhood`, etc.)",

          "body": "Thanks @ogrisel for the detailed review. Concerning the tests, I have added the method in all pre-existing tests. As you can see one of them compares the kPCA+linear kernel results with PCA. So if randomized_svd is well implemented in PCA, this test ensures that it is in kPCA, too.\r\n\r\nBut I agree that this was not very satisfying, so I created a new test (not pushed yet). In this test I compare both the result and execution times of the 'dense', 'arpack' and 'randomized' methods on a randomly generated dataset, so as to assert both time performance gain and accuracy.\r\n\r\nWith 5000 random samples and n_component = 50, it will hopefully show the performance gain (currently I have the following running times:  dense: 13s, arpack: 19s, randomized: 1s). I will try to come up with some plots to see the exec times evolution according to the number of components.\r\n\r\nWhile doing my experiments I discovered that I need to add safety protection against negative and imaginary eigenvalues for this method. Typically if I find an imaginary eigenvalue I will raise and error and if I find a negative eigenvalue I will just display a warning.\r\n\r\nWhich error type and warning mechanism should I use so as to match the scikit-learn best practices ?\r\n\r\n",

What do you think of the execution time plot? Is the small time improvement worth it?\r\n\r\nI just want to make sure this would be a welcome addition before reviewing #12145 and this one in more depth. I've already reviewed #12143 and I think it could/should be merged regardless of this one.",

          "body": "Thanks for the review @NicolasHug. \r\n\r\n * concerning the plots in the example, I did include them in [a message above](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12069#issuecomment-424297468) (note: you have to ask github to load all hidden items in the middle of this conversation), and commited a dedicated example to reproduce the plots. One can visually detect no difference.\r\n\r\n * Very good catch concerning #12143 and #12145: indeed they popped up when I added the randomized method. The main reason seems that the randomized method seems to naturally find the \"perfect zero eigenvalues\" while arpack and dense methods most of the time find a tiny non-zero number instead (e.g. of the order of magnitude of 1e-16 if my memory is correct). So when I tried the new method on random data I quickly found the first zero eigenvalue, which made the division by zero bug appear. For the record this is why I actually struggled quite a lot to find [a small example reproducing the zero division bug with dense method](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/12141#issuecomment-427752381) :)\r\n\r\n * Concerning the improvement, the benchmark plot already shows 4x faster running times for small amount of dimensions (a gain which is much smaller on the 2D example I admit), but on real-world timeseries data, on matlab environment, we found out that the randomized method could speed up running times more than 10 times and sometimes (very large datasets), it would make a decomposition computable when it would not be computable at all with the full decomposition method because of memory issues. \r\n\r\n * Finally this PR is an open road to integrate the lobpcg solver too by [adding these 6 lines in `_fit_transform`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12319/files#diff-4143e2be661b19bdff49616c76de91c3R538). I did not do it yet because I wanted to be sure that it would be ok to add it in the same PR, and I am still not sure if it brings better results (did not make the test yet) ; but it makes a lot of sense because that would make `KernelPCA` completely consistent in terms of solvers, with the solvers in `PCA` and `TruncatedSVD`. At least that's what [the author of lobpcg suggests](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/12068#issuecomment-424089267).\r\n\r\nJust for information, are we supposed to add ourselves in the authors names list at the top of the file when we propose such PRs ?\r\nThanks again for the careful reviews.",

In practice 100 components are enough to get a fairly good approximation of the underlying distribution for many real-world datasets - even if you have more data to provide you should not need many more components to describe them. The execution times speak for themselves:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3236794/47025807-797d7500-d164-11e8-912e-4682e27b018b.png)\r\n\r\nEDIT: another run with arpack:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3236794/47029170-2b1fa480-d16b-11e8-8480-e8d71f2900bb.png)\r\n",

          "body": "@jnothman Thanks for the review, I'll be addressing those issues shortly. I have a question about checking if SelfTrainingClassifier is fitted. I know about `sklearn.utils.validation.check_is_fitted`, but it only seems to verify that an attribute exists. \r\n\r\nSince this class (unlike other estimators) doesn't create any attributes during the fitting process that would signify that fitting is done, would it be acceptable to introduce a signifier variable (something like `is_fitted`) during the fit method, such that `check_is_fitted(self, \"is_fitted\")` returns true iff the estimator is fitted?\r\n\r\nEDIT: or I could perhaps create an attribute `base_estimator_` that is cloned from `base_estimator` at the start of the fit method, and then fit that estimator.

Currently it doesn't, but assumes that the implicit zeros have no effect on the data distribution.\r\n\r\nThe issue is from the `numpy.interp1d` which does crazy stuff at the bounds. Considering the following matrix:\r\n\r\n```python\r\narray([[0, 0],\r\n       [0, 0],\r\n       [1, 0]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe sparse output will be:\r\n```python\r\narray([[ 0.,  0.],\r\n       [ 0.,  0.],\r\n       [ 1.,  0.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the sparse case, we do not compute the mapping with `interp1d` of the 0s since they will be 0s anyway.\r\n\r\nFor the dense case, the results is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\narray([[ 0.24724725,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 0.24724725,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 1.        ,  1.        ]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich can be reproduce with the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nreference = np.linspace(0, 1, num=1000)\r\nq = np.percentile(X.A, reference, axis=0)\r\ni0 = interp1d(q[:, 0], reference)\r\ni1 = interp1d(q[:, 1], reference)\r\nprint(i0(0))\r\nprint(i1(0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get\r\n\r\n```python\r\n0.24724725\r\n1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe hacking to get the same value between dense and sparse is to avoid using `interp1d` for the lower and upper bounds and map them to 0. and 1.\r\n\r\n@jnothman @ogrisel @tguillemot  any thoughts?\r\n\r\nPS: Just by curiosity, what are we still supporting such old numpy like 1.6.

Btw. we should also add some documentation here. I think what is implemented here is nothing less then a copula transform. Btw. @robince this maybe of interest to you.",

It is well cited (but that does not suffice to make me enthusiastic). More importantly, it fills in nicely a niche for which we have no tool in scikit-learn. Indeed, experience shows that such approach is preferable to agglomerative clustering if the number of clusters is small compared to the number of data points (that's a comment that could be added to the docs to help users decide which algorithm investigate).",

Repeat step 2, the bisecting step, for ITER times and take the split that produces the clustering with the highest overall similarity.   \r\n>4. Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 until the desired number of clusters is reached. \r\n>\r\n>There are a number of different ways to choose which cluster is split. For example, we can choose the largest cluster at each step, the one with the least overall similarity, or use a criterion based on both size and overall similarity. We did numerous runs and determined that the differences between methods were small. In the rest of his paper we split the largest remaining cluster.\r\n\r\nNote step 1: \"**Pick a cluster to split**\". In your implementation, this step is always done out of the two most recently split clusters. Instead, we should pick the next cluster to split out of the entire set of clusters, implementing one of the two selection methods proposed, either the largest cluster, or the one with the least overall similarity.",

For example, we can choose the largest cluster at each step, the one with the least overall similarity, or use a criterion based on both size and overall similarity. We did numerous runs and determined that the differences between methods were small. In the rest of his paper we split the largest remaining cluster.\r\n> \r\n> Note step 1: \"**Pick a cluster to split**\". In your implementation, this step is always done out of the two most recently split clusters. Instead, we should pick the next cluster to split out of the entire set of clusters, implementing one of the two selection methods proposed, either the largest cluster, or the one with the least overall similarity.\r\n\r\nI've spotted some different picking tactics as e.g picking by least number of centroids , but that I've picked seems to be most popular. Maybe It should also be considered to allow other picking methods in the future.\r\n\r\nThe way I've implemented it - it firstly find pair of clusters with lowest inertia from data left to cluster. I quite don't undestand you at this point, cause if you spilit out entire set of cluster you would give up with bisection (which is essence of this algorithm) or if you just pick from all calculated clusters the one that seem to achieve best and worst SSE (or other checked metrics) - They may have been no more themselves after reassiging points to those centroids",

I can successfully get a speed-up around 2x to 3x w.r.t. traditional `RandomizedSearchCV` with 100 candidates. If both cases it seems that a 2 round halving strategy with a ratio of 10 works well.\r\n\r\n- First round: `n_candidates=100` and `max_iter=10` or `n_samples=10%`\r\n- Second round: `n_candidates=10` and `max_iter=100` or `n_samples=100%`\r\n\r\nLower ratios tend to yield to low `min_resources` values which can in turn favor too high learning rate models (when `resource=\"max_iter\"`) or too heavily regularized models when `resource=\"n_samples\"` in the first rounds leading to sub-optimal parameters for the final value of `max_iter` or `n_samples`.\r\n\r\n@amueller @NicolasHug I wonder what are you own experiences with this search strategy? Which parametrizations tend to yield good speed-ups vs a random search baseline?",

We say something about it in the user guide but I'll emphasize with your example.\r\n\r\nI haven't played myself too much with it honestly. I think that a ratio of 10 is pretty high.

It's been almost 1 year since I opened the PR (two days from now) and I feel we're going in circles again. I'll put this list on the #8960 description and wait for a final decision. I'll respect your decision on this, but I think I've made enough arguments about why `StackingTransformer` (maybe it's a bad name since there's no stacking going on there, I'll give you that) + pipelines API is superior to this implementation and the only thing against it is it's `fit.transform` vs `fit_transform` feels weird (it still works with all of scikit-learn's APIs, btw). \r\n\r\nI don't mean this post as a rant or anything like that. I just think it's been a really long time of discussions for us to be on the same spot we were 6 months ago.\r\n\r\n(cc @jnothman that's been following this for a while too now)",

However, based on my experience with implementing simple classes for stacking (with and without cross-validation) ... it kinda works to have these as standalone classes, but the problem for something like the scikit-learn API is that these would not support all features of the scikit-learn API and could lead to a \"buggy\" user experience. E.g., gridsearch has the limitation that you cannot search over the meta-estimators parameters and the inner (hyperparameters of the level-1 and level-2 classifiers inside the meta-estimator) at the same time. There are probably other limitations as well. That's ok, because my implementations are not meant/guaranteed to be fully scikit-learn compatible, but I think for a scikit-learn implementation, going with a StackingTransformer would be the best way.\r\n",

Ah, sorry, my previous example was not correct and misleading; what I meant was searching over the `estimators` that are fed to Stacking estimator and the parameters of the estimators provided via `estimators`. E.g., something like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nparams = {'estimators__lr_C: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0],\r\n                  'estimators': [[('lr', LogisticRegression()), ('svc1', LinearSVC())],\r\n                                        [('lr', LogisticRegression()), ('svc2', SVC())]]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem in my implementation was/is that e.g. that settings via `'estimators__lr_C: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]` will be overwritten by `'estimators': [[('lr', LogisticRegression()), ('svc1', LinearSVC())],...` when I remember correctly. \r\n\r\nMaybe something like this would be good to add as a unit test?

The original thread \nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/scikit-learn/mailman/message/32457192/\nhad links to algorithms that are very classic of outlier detection (I\nhave in particular in mind LOF). We should implement, tune and benchmark\nthese, before the fancier version. In addition, some of these are rather\neasy to implement, and can be made very fast.\n",

I didn't add it into this PR yet - I wanted to keep the PR small, so I could get easy feedback from people whether this is a feasible route to go.\n\n> Also, shouldn't we do uniform bins and percentile bins in the same estimator? It's such a minor change. Any other obvious binning methods we might want to have?

This PR should only contain binning for `k` fixed bins. I can definitely extend the work more later on.\n",

But ultimately what that means is the algorithm will transform a sparse array to a dense array (before another transform to transform it back to a sparse array). This is what we were trying to avoid in #5825. (Which is what led to the long discussion in that PR.)\n\nMy solution would preserve the sparsity of the input matrix, which is most ideal. It's complex, but I don't think it's unreadable.\n",

Why do we burden the user with that?\n\nAnd if we one-hot-encode the data, what does that mean for sparse data?\n\n@mblondel can you maybe give an example of your use case? I think I don't understand it.\n\nI though the standard use-case of this would be some continuous features that you want to discretize and then learn a linear model on. That would work well with fixed width and quantiles and (at least with newer numpy) could be done in a couple of lines.\n\nWhat is the sparse matrix use-case, what data representation do you want to get out and what models do you want to use?\n",

It turned out that this causes a _massive_ improvement in terms of performance (it's about an order of magnitude or even more):\n\nMadelon:\ntime: 0:00:00.776095 (that's 0.7 sec)\nscore: 0.741666666667\n\nArcene:\ntime: 0:00:00.125336 (that's 0.1 sec)\nscore: 0.58\n\nThe code is here:\nhttps://github.com/pprett/scikit-learn/tree/bdholt1-enh/tree\n\nWhen you look at _tree.pyx you see new extension types at the top (`ClassificationCriterion` and `RegressionCriterion`).\nThey implement the update logic; label counts (aka `pm`) for left and right branch for classification; label means for left and right branch for regression. The concrete subclasses (`Gini`, `Entropy`, and `MSE`) implement an `eval` method which computes the value of the splitting criterion. \n",

          "body": "I'm not too surprised about the performance.  Technically a decision tree is more of a non-parametric classifier than non-linear - it works by partitioning up the feature space perpendicular to the dimensions in a greedy fashion, which is quite different to casting it into a higher dimensional space and finding a separating hyperplane...  The good news is that Orange's performance is in the same ballpark, and I've worked through the algorithm quite thoroughly so I'm confident its doing it correctly.  Hopefully we will see a significant performance gain when it comes to using these trees in a forest.  Forests will compete with the best classifiers out there. \n",

I am planning to investigate the role of the forgetting factor on the loss: from Fevotte et al. it seems that this factor and then a good solution, depend on the number of samples and the batch size.\r\n\r\nHere what is still needed for this PR:\r\n- [x] investigate the role of the forgetting factor in the loss estimation (~and improve it, hopefully~ it turns out that the expected loss should be investigated instead).\r\n- [x] make the forgetting factor a parameter and suggest possible optimizations depending on the dimensions of the problem\r\n- [x] avoid code duplication (`non_negative_factorization` and `non_negative_factorization_online` are quite the same function right now)\r\n- [x] improve tests (I am open to suggestions for testing [those lines](https://codecov.io/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/compare/576775d6d15b7b69aebd2c464d932c28722eb4a0...6b930d9557a1776730abdd42d4c34c94d61a3d26/src/sklearn/decomposition/_nmf.py?before=sklearn/decomposition/_nmf.py#D1-712))\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1662261/91660689-98c2e880-ead7-11ea-905a-c291f8be8f6e.png)\r\n- [x] write documentation (!)\r\n\r\nThanks for listening and let me know if you have any comment or suggestion.",

          "body": "@cmarmo : looking at the graphs, I believe that I understand that the online code goes much much faster, but optimizes less well. This is expected: the online optimizer is good for the \"expected loss\", which is out of sample, and not the empirical loss, which is on the samples seen.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to add to the benchmarks an out-of-sample loss: on new data, computing the loadings for a given set of components. This is a measure of the expected loss. I haven't looked at the code, so I do not know how easy it is to optimize.\r\n\r\nFinally, in terms of graph, I think that I would suggest plotting the loss as a function of time, and displaying the sample size using circles of different sizes (plt.plot for the lines and plt.scatter for the circles).",

Indeed, large batch sizes reduce the noise in the estimates per batch.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of completeness here the same plot as before (n_test=7000 n_train=12000) for batch_size = 500\r\n![benchmark_nmf_blog_authorship](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1662261/92399605-d99bac80-f12a-11ea-9132-099f250a3895.png)\r\n\r\n",

Changing it to 1e-3 makes NMF fails, so this issue is not specific to MiniBatchNMF.\r\n\r\n- The discrepency is more important with the multiplicative update solver. Switching solver makes the common test fail (even a 1e-2), so it's not catch by the current common test because default is 'cd' but for minibatchnmf it's 'mu' so you trigger the failure.\r\n\r\n- The main issue that noticed for the \"mu\" solver is the difference of initialization between fit and transform.\r\n   In fit, W and H are initialized according to the init parameter, while in transform W is initialized to a constant matrix for 'mu' and to zeros for 'cd'. While for 'cd' it seems to not be a big issue, for 'mu' it is. Mainly, if the init contains zeros at fit time they are propagated all the way while there'll be no zeros at transform time.\r\n\r\nI think the issue should be solved separately since it's more general. I'll open an issue\r\n  ",

(At least for L2 regularization, not sure about the others.

Note that for the error vs. batch_size tests, RandomizedPCA was not shown because it is significantly worse in all tested cases. This makes sense - random projections _should_ be worse than projections estimated from the data (in general). The PCA lines in error and time vs. batch_size are constant because PCA has no batch_size, but it makes a good reference to compare against. \n\nNote that the \"jagged plot\" has a y scale of 1E-8... pretty sure this is just small  numerical differences - the average is consistent with PCA across batch size (and the change is +- 5e-8, which seems OK to me).\n",

Working on a commit now with calculations and unit tests, and will post some plots when that is done. This _should_ mean that whitening can be added as well.\n\nI guess now is a good time to start the discussion about inverse_transform whitening - I think it is preferable to invert the whitening as well, even though PCA doesn't currently do this. Because there is no prior usage of IncrementalPCA module, we would be starting off \"correctly\" IMO without the baggage/possible deprecation that may have to happen in PCA.

It seems closer to correct (errors are close to 0 for n_components=n_features, and otherwise similar to the previous calculation), but the \"bump\" in the chart leads me to believe that some kind of compensation has to happen when batches are different sizes. around 7500, where the bump is the worst, there are 2 batches - one of 5000, and one of 2500. Ideally, this plot should converge toward 0 as batch size increases.\n",

However, after talking with @ogrisel I am going to try using an online variance estimate (such as discussed [here](http://www.johndcook.com/standard_deviation.html)) and see if that gets a more accurate estimate of the ratio - .05 out of a total of 1.0 is still 5% error...\n",

You'll need to introduce lower and upper bounds to the nodes values for monotonic constraints to be properly enforced (see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15582/files#diff-9bd2ee07fb6817a0aee54f959d32de8aR139).",

I don't see any way around adding lower and upper bounds to the `Splitter` in `tree._splitter` just like you did for the `Splitter` in `ensemble._hist_gradient_boosting.splitting`.\r\nThere is still a question regarding the choice of the values of these bounds, but I will most likely stick to using the parent's value for each new \"inner\" bound.\r\n\r\nI also think the `monotonic_cst` parameter is better than having two lists of indices for decreasing and increasing constraints, so I will switch to this in order to keep consistency between the two APIs.",

In particular, it is my intuition that we could squash some of the functions _logistic\\* and _logistic_*_intercept without sacrificing a significant amount of performance\n- [x] sparse matrix support (any help from the people who actually use sparse matrices would be great here)\n- [x] implement multinomial logistic or raise a meaningful error for multiclass pointing to OvA, OvO meta-estimators\n- [x] More tests for LogisticCV object (and some are failing)\n- [x] Document tolerance and stopping criterions\n",

          "body": "@agramfort and @GaelVaroquaux I think I have gone through the code and I have the following things that I would need to do in the summer.\n1. Support for sparse matrices in Logistic Regression CV. If we observe logistic_regression_path works well with sparse matrices, but LogRegCV doesn't . I should fix that.\n2. Cs is constant at 10 if not provided. Shouldn't we have a grid of Cs similar to _alpha_grid where alpha_max is max (X_y_*2) that depends on input?\n3. Add more tests for Logistic Regression CV. Currently there is only one trivial test.\n   4 I don't think there is a normalize option. I suppose it should be necessary, Also a query, why do we find the intercept explicitly in fit_intercept = True case? Why don't we just center the data just like in ElasticNetCV (etc)\n4. Refactor the helper methods. I'm sure this can be done.\n5. Cythonise the newton's method on the lines of enet_coordinate_descent? Would this give speed-ups? What do you guys think?\n\nThis should take atleast 3 - 4 weeks of my summer I guess. Your opinion?\n",

It's an attempt to implement some of the propositions in #10744.\r\nCurrently this is only done for the lloyd algorithm.\r\nThe main difference with the current implementation is running the steps of the algorithm over data chunks, allowing better cache optimization and parallelization.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is still WIP and there's a lot more work to do, any comment is appreciated.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 2 implementations of lloyd algorithm, triggered by the `precompute_distances` parameter. When False, the pairwise distances between the data points and the centers are computed in a cython loop, using level 1 BLAS functions. This is not efficient. When True, the pairwise distances are precomputed before the cython loop, using level 3 BLAS functions through numpy.dot. This is very efficient. However the obtained pairwise distances matrix can be quite large and does not fit in the cpu cache which may cause a big overhead.\r\n\r\nThe proposed implementation tries to solve both issues. The pairwise distance matrix is precomputed using level 3 BLAS functions, one data chunk at a time. This would result in simpler implementation: no need for 2 different implementations.\r\nAlso it may also allow a better parallelization, at the chunks loop level (although this need more test right now).\r\n\r\nThis first implementation shows improvement, on single thread, by a factor of 2 to 8 versus master (I'll post some benchmarks soon). However it is still slower than the intel implementation by a factor of 2, and I need to investigate further.\r\n\r\nThere is still a long todo list\r\n- [x] publish benchmarks on single and mutli thread.\r\n\r\n- [x] find good chunk size is important for the performances\r\n\r\n- [x] add sample weight\r\n\r\n- [x] support sparse\r\n\r\n- [x] clean now unnecessary code\r\n\r\n- [x] investigate the elkan algorithm\r\n\r\n- ~~investigate the centers initialization (kmeans++)~~ (will do in separate PR)\r\n\r\n\r\n Fixes #9943, fixes #10744",

          "body": "Here comes some benchmarks showing the importance of choosing the right chunk size. The following plot shows the time of a single kmeans iteration for several chunk sizes. The chunk size is the number of samples per chunk. This correspond to a memory allocation of size `chunk_size x n_clusters` for the pairwise distance matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n![kmeans_vs_chunk_size_x2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34657725/45482053-561e6f00-b74d-11e8-84ce-2a7a2ea5527e.png)\r\n\r\nIf the chunk size is too small (<2\u2077 here) the overhead of ~~-I guess- malloc/free is too high~~. *Edit: after investigation, malloc/free are really fast compared to the computation time. It's more probably the fact that the flops are lower for smaller matrix multiplications.*\r\nIf `chunk_size < 2\u00b9\u2070`, the pairwise distance matrix fits into the L2 cache and the performance is the best possible. \r\nIf `chunk_size < 2\u00b9\u2079`, the pairwise distance matrix no longer fits into the L2 cache but still fits into the L3 cache. The performance decreases a bit. \r\nBeyond that, the pairwise distance matrix does not fit in the cache and performance decreases again.\r\n<br></br>\r\nHere are some more benchmarks showing that the gain of performance of fitting into L2 if often surpassed by the overhead (when n_clusters is too high then the chunk size has to be too small to fit into L2), and that the loss of performance of not fitting into L3 can be quite large.\r\n\r\n![kmeans_vs_chunk_size_2_x2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34657725/45482186-9da4fb00-b74d-11e8-9224-a0cd54248a03.png)\r\n![kmeans_vs_chunk_size_3_x2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34657725/45482191-a1d11880-b74d-11e8-963d-7814e44ae01f.png)\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nBased on this, a very simple strategy can be used for choosing the chunk size, at least on single thread. We want to choose the smallest chunk size that implies no overhead. 2\u2078 seems to be a good candidate.\r\nThe good news is that we don't have to check the machine specs to choose the chunk size. The benchmarks on the post below are made with this unique chunk size and gave the best results.\r\n\r\nNote however that this is on single thread and that it will have to be adjusted for multi-threads. I'm running benchmarks for that and I'll put them here.",

          "body": "**Quick note about numerical precision issues**\r\n\r\nK-means being based on euclidean metric, it's impacted by #9354. Although we don't use `euclidean_distances`, we use the same trick for a fast computation of the pairwise distances matrix.\r\n\r\nHowever, the absolute values of the distances are irrelevant for this algorithm. What matters is their ordering. Therefore this numerical precision should have a minor effect on the clustering. I've made some tests and they seem to confirm that intuition. Below is an example of the clustering using the fast and the exact distance computation (data stored on float32). For this example, the final inertiae differ by about 1%. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34657725/46068978-ba442880-c17a-11e8-9b1b-134214a17b48.png)\r\n\r\nI made other tests with various kinds of clusters, scales, numbers, dimensions, and I haven't found a situation where this numerical precision issue disturbs the behavior of the algorithm. Therefore I suggest that we keep this fast method for computing the pairwise distances in K-means.\r\n\r\nThere is still a visible effect. Although the clustering is fine, the absolute distances might not be and the inertia could be wrongly evaluated. This is because the inertia is computed incrementally by the distances of each sample to it's closest center using the fast method. The solution is to compute the inertia using the stable method, once the labels are updated: `inertia = ((X - centers[labels])**2).sum()`",

          "body": "The y axis on my plots shows the time for a single iteration of k-means. You get the same speed up factor for the full `KMeans.fit()`, for any problem size.\r\n\r\nLet's say for example you have 100000 samples, 100 clusters, 10 features. One iteration takes ~25ms. If you have around 100 iterations until convergence (`max_iter` default is 300), the fit takes 2.5s, vs 5s+ before.\r\n\r\nNow if you have 10x more samples it's 25s vs 50s+.\r\nAnd if you put `n_init=10`, it's 250s vs 500s+.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the parallelization is now at the loop over samples level, which allows the possibility to use all cores. With the current parallelization being at the init level (which default is 10), you can only use `n_init` cores.\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example, let's take the example of color quantization in sklearn, but fitting the whole image, not a subsample. On master, it takes 164s, vs 27s with this implementation (on single thread).",

The `MultiOutput*` meta-estimators should support any estimator _including but not limited to_ the `OneVsRestClassifier`, which by itself is a meta-estimator!\n\n> leave regressors for a different PR.\n\nIndeed. regression meta-estimator could be done in a separate PR. And `partial_fit` support in a subsequent one after that.\n\nThanks for your patience!\n",

I believe `warm_start` starts training with the previously trained weights but does not necessarily use unsupervised learning algorithm for weight initialization.\n\n@jnothman yes, an RBM trains on the unlabeled samples and its new, trained weights become the initial weights of the corresponding layer in the multi-layer perceptron. The image below shows a basic idea of how this is done.\n![rbmdeepbeliefnetwork](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3382128/3089594/bda8ee14-e580-11e3-91dc-3a61e2410de4.png)\n",

          "body": "This looks pretty cool so far - I will run some trials on it and try to understand the py3 issues.\n\nThings that would be nice, though maybe not strictly necessary for a first cut PR:\n\nA constructor arg for a custom loss function instead of fixed (maybe it is against the API). Thinking of things like cross-entropy, hinge loss ala Charlie Tang, etc. instead of standard softmax or what have you. It would be nice to have a few default ones available by strings, with the ability to create a custom one if needed.\n\nI like @ogrisel's suggestion for layer_coefs_. It would be useful to run experiments with KMeans networks and also pretraining with autoencoders instead of RBMs. This also opens the door for side packages that can take in weights from other nets (looking at Overfeat, Decaf, Caffe, pylearn2, etc.) and load them into sklearn. This is more a personal interest of mine, but it is nice to see the building blocks there. \n\nIt is also plausible that very deep nets are possible to use in feedforward mode on the CPU, even if we can't train them in sklearn directly.\n\nQuestions:\nI see you have worked on deep autoencoders before - will this framework support that as well? In other words, can layer sizes be different but complimentary? Or are they expected to be a \"block\" (uniform in size)\n\nI also like the support for other optimizers - it would be sweet to get a hessian free optimizer into scipy, and use it in this general setup. Could make deep-ish NN work somewhat accessible without GPU, though cg is what (I believe) Hinton used for the original DBM/pretraining paper.\n",

          "body": "Hi @kastnerkyle and @ogrisel , thanks for the reply.\n\n1) <B>Custom loss function</B>: I could add a parameter to the constructor  that accepts strings for selecting the loss function. (In fact, I have done that in my older implementation, but was told to remove it since there weren't enough loss functions)\n\n2) <B>Pre-training</B>: I could add a pipeline with a placeholder that selects a pre-trainer for the weights. Although I was told to keep that for the next PR, I don't see it as a harm adding an additional constructor parameter and a small method  containing the pre-trainer for a quick test :).\n\n3) <B>Deep Auto-encoder</B>: yes, a sparse autoencoder is a simple adaptation of the feedforward network - I simply need to inject a sparsity parameter into the loss function and its derivatives.\n\n For the layer sizes, they can be different in any way- for example, 1024-512-256-128-64-28, but  - like what Hinton said - nothing justifies any set of layer sizes since it depends on the problem instance. Anyhow, this framework can support any set of layer sizes even if they are larger than the number of features.\n\n4) <B>Selecting scipy optimizers</B>: my older implementation of the vanilla MLP supported all scipy optimizers using the generic scipy minimize method, but there was one problem: it required users to have `scipy 13.0+`, while scikit-learn requires  SciPy (>= 0.7). If we could raise the scipy version requirement, I could easily have this support all scipy optimizers.\n\nAnyhow, L-bfgs is now state-of-the-art optimizer. I tested it against CG and L-BFGS always performed better and faster than CG for several datasets (most other optimizers were unsuitable and did not come any close to CG and l-bfgs as far as speed and accuracy are concerned, but the scipy method also supports custom optimizers which is very useful). \n\nThis claim is also justified by Adam Coates and Andrew Ng. here http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/?portfolio=on-optimization-methods-for-deep-learning\n\nBut I did read that CG can perform better and faster for special kinds of datasets. So I am all for adding the generic scipy optimizer if it wasn't for the minimum version issue. What do you think?\n\nFor the ufunc fix, did you mean `sklearn.utils.fixes` ? because my sklearn version doesn't have `sklearn.utils.exists` :( . I added the fix to `sklearn.utils.fixes` and pushed the code to see if it resolves the `expit` problem.\n\nThank you.\n",

I also didn't understand what you meant by \"rectangular matrix\". \r\n\r\nI'll fix the rest of the comments. If you think having the stack factory is too much, I'm not opposed to deleting the fn \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI think I understood the \"rectangular matrix\" issue. It was actually a bad name choice that I made, which was enforced by the `stack_estimators` example code. The `estimators_matrix` is actually a 2D array, not a matrix. Hopefully it's clearer now \r\n\r\nEDIT2:\r\nI started working in the documentation, but I'd rather wait for us to agree on the final API before going any further.",

          "body": "thanks for your input @reiinakano !\r\nabout having an extra `StackMetaEstimator` class: by extracting the blending from the stacking I get some advantages:\r\n1. I don't need to re-implement `FeatureUnion`'s feature concatenating: each estimator is turned into a transformer. This is good, specially if you notice that `FeatureUnion` [can evolve](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9008) independently and may contain really useful stuff. All of the stuff implemented in `FeatureUnion` is orthogonal to the blending step, so no need to mush both things into a single class;\r\n2. I get a smaller unity of work, so if I want to pre-blend some single estimator and use it somewhere else I can with no hassle. This makes it easier to do some cool things, like making stacking fully distributed, sharing blended models for collaboration, etc.\r\n\r\nAbout the \"all in one go\" vs \"step by step\": I think that's actually a misconception. You can say that Xcessiv's implementation has an \"all in one go\" class, but that doesn't make it any different than using factory methods (ugh) for abstracting the construction.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I get the problem with `_check_is_permutation`: could you provide an example?",

          "body": "It seems to be a good moment to stop for a second and consider another interesting and relevant practice in stacking, that is feature stacking. My goal is to ensure that the developments here will not obstruct or block support for feature stacking at an early stage. So what is this and why it interesting. In many applied contexts, one may want to learn a model on features from different domains, governed by different distributions and covariance functions, e.g., Text and images, images and signals, continuous and discrete variables etc. Sometimes it can be more advisable to map each of these input sources to different first-level learners or simply don't estimate one single joint model for these different classes of inputs.\r\nAs the variant proposed here, the feature stacking would use learning on stacked layers of predictions. The main difference is that the different first level learners are trained on different columns of X. With @mrahim we did some API piloting for this use case and wrote tests that ensure compatibility with sklearn function, such as ```cross_val_score```. The idea would then be to allow the stacking learner to assign to each 1st level learner a different subset of columns in X, which we call ```feature_indices``` in our code. Please have a look at https://github.com/mrahim/stacked-learn/blob/master/examples/stacking_example.py to get an idea about that kind of API.\r\nFinally, we may want to ensure that model stacking and feature stacking can be combined, or that hierarchical features tacking is possible. Imagine you have 2 types of data, say images and signals from 2 different sites. To take into account these hierarchies, one may want to train separate models on each site and on each input type, which could be achieved by feature stacking of feature stacking classifiers. Ans so on.\r\nAs far as I can see it would not be difficult to support an API that enables mapping between feature sets and estimators in the stacking context.\r\n\r\ncc @GaelVaroquaux @jnothman ",

General tests\n  - Assert that `partial_fit` returns `self`. - Thanks @jnothman for [the suggestion.](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3896#issue-50330161)\n  - Clone test... `assert clone(est).partial_fit == est.partial_fit`\n- [x] 2. Check that an error is raised if the number of features changes.\n- [x] 3. Estimator reset test\n  - Check that doing `fit` after a set of `fit` / `partial_fit` restarts the estimator.\n  - Assert that `partial_fit` and then `fit` with a different number of features works without raising any Exceptions... - Thanks @amueller for [the suggestion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3907#issuecomment-68411916)\n- [x] 4. Check if `partial_fit` does not overwrite the previous model.\n  - Based on @jnothman [suggestion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3907#issuecomment-68478630)\n- [x] 5. Check that classifier handles correctly the classes argument in the `partial_fit`.\n  - a. Check if mismatch between `classes` argument and `np.unique(y_i)` raises `ValueError`.\n  - b. Check that error is raised if `classes` is not specified during first `partial_fit` call.\n  - c. Check error is not raised if `classes` is not specified during subsequent calls.\n- [x] Helper functions\n  - `_validate_y_against_classes` - Check label mismatch between `y` and `classes` arg\n  - `assert_same_model(X, est1, est2)`\n  - `assert_not_same_model(X, est1, est2)`\n    - Use `predict`, `transform`, `decision_function` and `predict_proba` to check equality of models.\n  - In `sklearn.utils.estimator_checks` `_partial_fit` and `_fit` to use the appropriate parameters.\n  - `assert_attributes_equal(est1, est2)`\n  - `assert_attributes_not_equal(est1, est2)`\n  - `assert_array_not_equal`\n\n**Refs**\nAlso see #406 - This PR fixes 1st under not so easy for pfit-able estimators, via 3a ( of this PR )\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/3907)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

I think it should either raise an error or it should overwrite and do a new fit from the beginning, if one calls partial_fit after fit. If partial_fit starts from where fit left, then it does not make a difference whether you fit or partial_fit, right? ;)\n",

I just modified the `method_filter` to accept `!` as a prefix to the method names...\n\n[ @amueller perhaps such a functionality could be useful for `type_filter` too? ]\n\nSo for estimators that are not Transformers:\n`ests = all_estimators(method_filter=[\"predict\", \"!transform\", \"partial_fit\"])` \n\nAnd for Transformers with `partial_fit` capability :\n`ests = all_estimators(method_filter=[\"transform\", \"partial_fit\"], type_filter=\"transformer\")`\n`# The type filter is perhaps redundant here`\n\nExcuse me if I understood your comment incorrectly...\n",

Explain your changes.\r\nThis PR adds the infrequent categories to `OneHotEncoder` by:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `return_counts` to `_encode` to return the counts of the categories.\r\n2. Adjust `_BaseEncoder._fit` and `_BaseEncoder._transform` to accept callables, which can adjust the processing of categories and unknown categories.\r\n3. <s>Deprecates 'ignore' in favor of 'auto'. 'auto' behaves like 'ignore' when there are no infrequent categories in training. If there are infrequent categories in training, then unknown categories are considered infrequent.</s>\r\n4. For the inverse transform and feature names, the infrequent category with the highest cardinality will be used.\r\n\r\n### Update\r\n\r\nAs of [`ef86eb1` (#16018)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16018/commits/ef86eb1fee42c6be9012b95acdf1652abe8f36b0) `'ignore'` is option remains and an `infrequent_if_exist` option was added to `handle_unknown`. The `infrequent_if_exist` behaves just like `'ignore'` when there are no infrequent categories for a feature. If a feature does have infrequent categories, then unknown categories will be mapped to the infrequent category.\r\n\r\n<s>#### Why deprecated `'ignore'`?\r\n\r\nThe motivation to deprecate `'ignore'` is connected to how it interacts with infrequent categories. In the following example, feature 0 has infrequent categories and feature 1 does not. This means that feature 0 will map the unknown category to be infrequent, while feature 1 \"ignores\" the unknown category:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nX = pd.DataFrame({\r\n    \"col1\": ['a'] * 30 + ['b'] * 15 + ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'],\r\n    \"col2\": ['one'] * 25 + ['two'] * 25\r\n})\r\n\r\nohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, min_frequency=2, handle_unknown='auto').fit(X)\r\nohe.transform([['g', 'three']])\r\n# array([[0., 0., 1., 0., 0.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If** we were to keep `'ignore'`, we would run into the following behavior:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# This errors right now\r\nohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, min_frequency=2, handle_unknown='ignore').fit(X)\r\nohe.transform([['g', 'three']])\r\n# array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, all unknown categories are mapped to zero, regardless of there being a infrequent category for the feature. A while ago me and @amueller discussed this and concluded that this behavior is not desirable.</s>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

          "body": "The motivation to deprecate `'ignore'` is connected to how it interacts with infrequent categories. In the following example, feature 0 has infrequent categories and feature 1 does not. This means that feature 0 will map the unknown category to be infrequent, while feature 1 \"ignores\" the unknown category:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nX = pd.DataFrame({\r\n    \"col1\": ['a'] * 30 + ['b'] * 15 + ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'],\r\n    \"col2\": ['one'] * 25 + ['two'] * 25\r\n})\r\n\r\nohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, min_frequency=2, handle_unknown='auto').fit(X)\r\nohe.transform([['g', 'three']])\r\n# array([[0., 0., 1., 0., 0.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If** we were to keep `'ignore'`, we would run into the following behavior:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# This errors right now\r\nohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, min_frequency=2, handle_unknown='ignore').fit(X)\r\nohe.transform([['g', 'three']])\r\n# array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, all unknown categories are mapped to zero, regardless of there being a infrequent category for the feature. A while ago me and @amueller discussed this and concluded that this behavior is not desirable.",

Because the scalers pass it through (and the tag says they \"handle\" missing data) and the imputers impute it. So either these need different tags or we just punt on defining tags for pipelines and if you want to run a pipeline the author of the pipeline needs to set the tags specifically for that pipeline if they want to run the tests. That seems not the best, though.",

          "body": "Ok, so @GaelVaroquaux @jnothman I need some input. My current solution for ``_get_tags`` is not working. This is a bit lengthy but I'm stuck and I don't understand the motivation for our current class hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI'm confused by the method resolution order in our class hierarchy.\r\nWe always write the ``BaseEstimator`` to the left, which means it comes in the mru before the mixins, which means the mixins can't actually change any of the ``BaseEstimator`` behavior.\r\nSo if I declare some basic tags in ``BaseEstimator`` and want to extend them in ``ClassifierMixin``, I need to call ``super`` in ``BaseEstimator``, and then handle the return from the mixin. That seems really weird to me.\r\n\r\nI assumed I can call ``super`` in the mixin and they'll all resolve before ``BaseEstimator``, but exactly the opposite is the case.\r\n\r\nI can see the following ways to fix this:\r\n\r\n1.  actually call ``super`` in the ``BaseEstimator`` and in all mixins and check if ``super`` has the ``_get_tags`` method (it could always be ``object`` as far as I can see). The code in ``BaseEstimator`` then is a bit weird because it needs to take the defaults and overwrite them with what was given by the ``super`` call. This solution feel really wrong to me.\r\n\r\n2. Make all mixins inherit from ``BaseEstimator`` and remove ``BaseEstimator`` from all the estimators (if we add it to the mixins, the compiler requires us to remove it from the estimators to have a well-defined mru). This puts ``BaseEstimator`` on the top of the class hierarchy and it will always resolve last and everything is good.\r\n\r\n3. Change the inheritance order in all estimators to have ``BaseEstimator`` at the very right. That puts it last in the mru and everthing is good.\r\n\r\n4. Add a base-class (I call it ``KingOfDiamonds``) on top of BaseEstimator and all the mixins, and implement the default ``_get_tags()`` there. ``BaseEstimator`` doesn't even need to implement ``_get_tags`` then, only ``KingOfDiamonds`` needs to. It will always be last in mru and everything is good.\r\n\r\nFrom a code perspective 4 is least intrusive (least number of lines changed), but it adds another layer to the inheritance hierarchy.\r\n3 is the least intrusive in terms of class hierarchy, it \"only\" changes the mru. It relies on the order of the classes in multiple inheritance, though, which seems somewhat fragile (*).\r\n2 is somewhere in between because it changes both the inheritance structure and the code, but it's relatively robust and doesn't introduce another class.\r\n\r\n* With the current setup, if two mixins try to change the same tag, but in opposite directions, then the order of the mixins will matter. That seems like a bad idea that can be avoided in practice, though.\r\n\r\nWhat is the motivation to have BaseEstimator to the left in the first place, and why don't we let the mixins inherit from it?\r\n",

          "body": "> I think another partial solution is that _get_tags could be conventionally defined with a helper, like:\r\n\r\n> def _get_tags(self):\r\n    return base.extend_tags(self, tags={'a': 5, 'b': 6}, allow_overwrite=['b'])\r\n\r\n> extend_tags would be implemented to allow super's _get_tags to not exist. allow_overwrite would ensure that no tag overwriting can take place, except where whitelisted. At least if I understand the problem, this should help...?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand the solution. ``base`` is ``sklearn.base``, right?\r\nWhat would happen if something tries to overwrite something that is already defined? Silently ignored, right?\r\n\r\nSo with silent pass I guess this would work if ``BaseEstimator`` has everything in ``allow_overwrite``, and all the others have nothing in ``allow_overwrite``. Because ``BaseEstimator._get_tags`` is called last, it would then not overwrite all the tags defined in the mixins which have been defined earlier.\r\nSo yes, I think that would work. I don't think it's pretty, though.\r\n\r\nWhat do you not like about the interface? Is it this exact inheritance issue? Having one attribute per tag would have the same issue, right?\r\nI'm actually quite happy with this interface. I was first a bit bummed that I need a helper function but I don't think there's a way around that.\r\n\r\nActually, another way to resolve the issue is to not give ``BaseEstimator`` a ``_get_tags`` at all and assume that all calls are done with the helper.",

          "body": "> I'm not yet convinced by the `^type` stuff within the router... I think it has been necessitated by combining a few things into one object:\r\n> * the information an estimator needs to give its caller for its caller to route effectively\r\n> * the information an estimator needs to manage its own routing\r\n> * the information an estimator needs to manage its request\r\n> \r\n> Can you justify these all being rolled into one object, returned by one method? And if all rolled into one object, is it right to mediate it by having objects of different `^type` with different corresponding structure/semantics?\r\n\r\n@jnothman in #21284 I started from thinking about these separations and it was implemented based on those concerns. As an alternative, this PR is developed having the developer API in mind as the first issue. I first wrote the example (`plot_metadata_request.py`) and then implemented what that API required.\r\n\r\n@glemaitre pointed out that there's some duplication in the logic of `get_metadata_request` and what goes in `fit`, and that the boilerplate code in `fit` requires people to understand the mechanism and distract them from the _math_ part of an estimator. As a result, in this PR I tried to capture all what is required to handle metadata routing in a single method/object, which is the `get_metadata_routing` and its output. Now the developer needs to only implement that method and there's pretty much no other boilerplate code to write. And for the routing mechanism which goes in other methods such as `fit`, the output of that method needs to have the information required for them to work.\r\n\r\nThis also means there are two types of objects returned by `get_metadata_routing` and therefore we need to store the type in the serialized version of the object.\r\n\r\nI'm not too bothered by this since users shouldn't be really looking at the output of this method. Now that the method returns the whole tree, it's easy to write utility methods which would better _explain_ or _visualize_ metadata routing.\r\n\r\nFor instance, this is the output `pipeline.get_metadata_routing()` in `test_nested_routing`:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\npipeline = SimplePipeline(\r\n    [\r\n        MetaTransformer(\r\n            transformer=TransformerMetadata()\r\n

At least as things are implemented now. To the point that right now we have `_get_metadata_request` and `get_metadata_router` which return two different objects of different types on a router+consumer object.\r\n\r\nMaking them (and `get_metadata_router` of a simple consumer) the same, would complicate things rather than simplify. Note that for a simple estimator, `get_metadata_router` returns a `MetadataRequest` and not a `MetadataRouter`, and hence it doesn't have a `$self` as you suggest.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\n",

          "body": "There are some changes in this PR now:\r\n\r\n- `get_metadata_routing` now returns the object, rather than the serialized version of it. `_metadata_reqeusts.py` is written in a way that people can vendor the file instead of depending on `scikit-learn`. The code avoids usages of `isinstance` to make this easier.\r\n- `_sentinels.py` is removed and we use invalid identifiers instead in `RequestType` enum, which also helps with third party developers being able to not have a hard dependency on scikit-learn.\r\n- in the string representation of routing objects, only non-empty methods are included.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the following to create the routing information:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n    def get_metadata_routing(self):\r\n        router = (\r\n            MetadataRouter()\r\n            .add(\r\n                transformer=self.transformer,\r\n                method_mapping=MethodMapping()\r\n                .add(method=\"fit\", used_in=\"fit\")\r\n                .add(method=\"transform\", used_in=\"fit\")\r\n                .add(method=\"transform\", used_in=\"predict\"),\r\n            )\r\n            .add(classifier=self.classifier, method_mapping=\"one-to-one\")\r\n        )\r\n        return router\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the following to validate/route metadata:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n    def fit(self, X, y, **fit_params):\r\n        params = process_routing(self, \"fit\", fit_params)\r\n\r\n        self.transformer_ = clone(self.transformer).fit(X, y, **params.transformer.fit)\r\n        X_transformed = self.transformer_.transform(X, **params.transformer.transform)\r\n\r\n        self.classifier_ = clone(self.classifier).fit(\r\n            X_transformed, y, **params.classifier.fit\r\n        )\r\n        return self\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is some people find the first part intuitively understandable as written, and some people would prefer the following variation:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n    def get_metadata_routing(self):\r\n        router = (\r\n            MetadataRouter()\r\n            .add(\r\n                transformer=self.transformer,\r\n                method_mapping=MethodMapping()\r\n                .add(dst=\"fit\", src=\"fit\")\r\n                .add(dst=\"transform\", src=\"fit\")\r\n                .add(dst=\"transform\", src=\"predict\"),\r\n            )\r\n            .add(classifier=self.classifier, method_mapping=\"one-to-one\")\r\n        )\r\n        return router\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like us to make the decision based on how the end-user/developer API is used rather than how it's implemented, and I'd like us to make that decision based on how users would feel about it. I think it would be nice for us to have a discussion on our mailing list and maybe social media to get some feedback before setting things on stone.",

After the first question, we can describe what the routing does and then ask a follow up comparing  (`src`, `dst`) and (`method`, `used_in`).\r\n\r\n#### Survey idea two\r\nAlternatively, we can describe what routing does, show both  (`src`, `dst`) and (`method`, `used_in`) and ask which one is easier to understand.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the most useful feedback would be from third-party estimator developers.",

Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements support for partial dependence plots with any regressor or classifier that has `predict_proba`.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nPartial dependence plots were only supported for gradient boosting trees and the functions were in `ensemble.partial_dependence`. All backward compatibility is preserved, but those functions are deprecated in favor of the `sklearn.partial_dependence` module.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `grid` param has been removed in the new implementation.\r\nThe `ax` param was replaced by `fig`. The claim that the new plots were plotted on the `ax` argument was wrong.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value\r\nall user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to\r\nreview, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,\r\nconvincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either\r\ncase, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\nFor more information, see our FAQ on this topic:\r\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/dev/faq.html#why-is-my-pull-request-not-getting-any-attention.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Some possible improvements\r\n\r\nIn separate PRs:\r\n\r\n- Add support for 3D plots instead of just a contour\r\n- Add support for https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf. Basically, instead of averaging the responses, we actually plot all of them. That would only be relevant for 1-way PDP.\r\n- Add support for plotting the same PDP of different estimators on the same matplotlib `ax` object.",

          "body": "There is an extension to the concept of partial dependence which I use for understanding models. It is best described by example. Suppose we have a binary variable X which we want the partial dependence of. Normally we average the predicted values for both X=0 and X=1 for the data points in each group. However, it is pretty common that data points themselves can be quite different. ie df[df['X']=1] and df[df['X']=0] have very different distributions in the dimensions other than X. This implies that the partial dependence of X is saying as much about the data distribution as it is about the model. To take out this effect I put all data in all points at each value of X instead of just the ones \"measured\" at that value. Explicitly I add the following two data sets to my data\r\n\r\nnew_X0 = df[df['X']==1]\r\nnew_X0['X']=0\r\n\r\nnew_X1 = df[df['X']==0]\r\nnew_X1['X']=1\r\n\r\nThis would double the size of my data and 'balance' it to take out the biases in the data. For context, if you are using the PDP to calculate the price index this is the same as ensuring the \"basket of goods\" is the same in each year. \r\n\r\nThis increases the data an hence computation time by a factor of df['X'].nunique() so it can be an issue if using the brute force method. For the estimate method it would actually be marginally faster since the average values would all be the same so the average only needs to be done once. \r\n\r\nI was hoping this functionality could be added as a flag in the function. I could help with the development of this if desired. Currently I just modify the data set before passing it to the PDP function but it is cumbersome. ",

I think at some point we even had some warning if someone was passing in the training data to `predict` (or `transform`?)\n\nWe could go the way of `kneighbors_graph` and do `predict()` to mean calling predict on the training X. it's odd if `fit(X).predict(X)` is not the same as `fit_predict(X)`.\n",

The output is a sparse distance/affinity matrix.\r\n\r\nThe proposed usecase is the following:\r\n```py\r\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\r\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsTransformer\r\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\r\n\r\nest_chain = make_pipeline(\r\n    KNeighborsTransformer(n_neighbors=n_neighbors, mode='distance',\r\n                          metric=metric, include_self=False),\r\n    TSNE(metric='precomputed', method=\"barnes_hut\"),\r\n    memory='path/to/cache')\r\n\r\nest_compact = TSNE(metric=metric, method=\"barnes_hut\")\r\n```\r\nIn this example `est_chain` and `est_compact` are equivalent, but `est_chain` gives more control on the nearest neighbors estimator. Moreover, it can use the pipeline caching properties, to reuse the same nearest neighbors matrix for different TSNE parameters. Finally, it is possible to replace `KNeighborsTransformer` with a custom nearest neighbors estimator returning the graph of connections with the nearest neighbors.\r\n___\r\nThis pipeline works with:\r\n- `TSNE`, `Isomap`, `SpectralEmbedding`\r\n- `DBSCAN`, `SpectralClustering`,\r\n- `KNeighborsClassifier`, `RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, `KNeighborsRegressor`, `RadiusNeighborsRegressor`, `LocalOutlierFactor`\r\n\r\nThis pipeline cannot work with:\r\n- `LocallyLinearEmbedding` (which needs the original X)\r\n___\r\nPossible improvements:\r\n- Add a kernel parameter to transform distances into affinities\r\n- Add symmetric option for affinities (to remove warning in SpectralEmbedding, SpectralClustering)",

          "body": "Nice work @TomDLT and thanks for the summary in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10463.\r\n\r\n> The key caveat is that it requires all required neighborhoods to be computed in advance. This may be a memory burden still for something like DBSCAN (although our current implementation is already memory heavy).\r\n> It would be really good if we could illustrate plugging in an approximate nearest neighbors estimator, but it would likely include adding a pyann or similar dependency, unless we attempt to write a very short LSH just to prove the point.\r\n\r\nThe API with a transformer looks quite nice, and caching the NN can certainly help for repeated estimators fits with different parameters.  However, as far as ANN are concerned I don't find it immediately obvious that pre-computing a sparse distance matrix with ANN, and e.g. using it in DBSCAN has an equivalent performance to directly using the ANN in the estimator. \r\n\r\nFor instance, I would be curious to know the results of the following benchmark. Take some low dimensional data where we know that kd_tree will perform well (e.g. `n_features=2`). Use it to pre-compute the sparse distance matrix and fit DBSCAN. Compare the performance to using  kd_tree directly in the DBSCAN.  This would allow estimating the overhead of this approach, without necessarily having to add an ANN implementation.",

          "body": "I'm not sure what you're trying to show about ANN with that, @rth. Currently DBSCAN calculates the nearest neighbors of all X once and computes the clustering from that. There is some overhead when passing in sparse D rather than just passing in features X: unpacking, thresholding on radius and repacking.\r\n\r\nThis is not how it was originally implemented, mind you, and was optimised for speed rather than memory (see e.g. #5275). Perhaps with a *NeighborsTransformer, we could go back to that original low memory implementation, but get most of the speed benefits as long as the user provides the precomputed sparse matrix.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of this design as opposed to #8999 is that there the host algorithm can pass in a `radius` or a `n_neighbors`, which would save time relative to precomputing and then filtering/checking the precomputed input. We also do not currently require that the precomputed input is in sorted order, so there is a `O(n_train_samples log n_train_samples)` cost per query in order to sort it. We could make some constraints on precomputed sparse matrix input  corresponding to `*neighbors_graph(None, mode='distance')` output (or check it and raise a warning but accept it) if we'd rather: it needs to be in CSR with each row's data increasing, and at train time the diagonal needs to be implicit, not stored zeros.\r\n\r\nOne advantage of this design as opposed to #8999 is that it may allow you to precompute more neighbors than you need, then estimate downstream with various parameters (e.g. DBSCAN.eps); thus it works well with caching pipelines. Of course you could do that with #8999 by implementing your own precomputed neighborhood wrapper.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all this, I think it would be good to give an example of, or at least describe, the use of this for exploiting approximate nearest neighbor approaches. Writing up a simple (but not super-efficient) gaussian projection hash, or a minhash, might not be excessive.",

Therefore, we always have `fit_transform` == `fit + transform`.\r\n- I modified the extraction of precomputed sparse neighbor graph in `self.kneighbors()` to remove the diagonal if `X=None`. This is used in `TSNE`, `Isomap` and `LOF`\r\n- I fixed an bug in `DBSCAN`: When the neighbors graph was precomputed, it assumed that it was computed with `include_self=False` and DBSCAN added the diagonal to be equivalent to `include_self=True`. In particular, if the diagonal was already present, it added the diagonal a second time. I fixed this bug, so `include_self=True` and `include_self=False` are now equivalent. **It will break code but I consider it as a bugfix.**\r\n___\r\nThe only caveat is that if you want to use `TSNE`, `Isomap` or `LOF` in a pipeline, you need to ask one more neighbor in the transformer:\r\n```py\r\n    est_chain = make_pipeline(\r\n        KNeighborsTransformer(n_neighbors=n_neighbors + 1, mode='distance'),\r\n        Isomap(n_neighbors=n_neighbors, neighbors_algorithm='precomputed'))\r\n\r\n    est_compact = Isomap(n_neighbors=n_neighbors, neighbors_algorithm=algorithm)\r\n```",

Based on a quick look at the test, hinge_loss_by_hand_part\\* refer to floats and thus the numpy method is giving you an error.\n\nIf I understand correctly, numpy.mean (or np.mean) accepts an array as an argument. (See the docs at http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html). \nCould you try to fixing it to \n\n```\nhinge_loss_by_hand = np.mean(np.array([hinge_loss_by_hand_part1, \nhinge_loss_by_hand_part2,  hinge_loss_by_hand_part3]))\n```\n\nand see if the test passes?\n",
