Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR introduces the core structure of the new localstack native implementation of event bridge. \r\nFurthermore, it implements the CRUD functionality based on snapshots of verified AWS tests. A clean pattern for keeping data stored in the AccountRegionBundle store separate from related functionality is required. Separation of different sender functionality based on the target should be handled more efficiently than in a if else chain.\r\nThese API operations are implemented:\r\n\r\n- create_event_bus\r\n- delete_event_bus\r\n- describe_event_bus\r\n- list_event_buses\r\n- enable_rule\r\n- delete_rule\r\n- describe_rule\r\n- disable_rule\r\n- list_rules\r\n- list_rule_names_by_target\r\n- put_rule\r\n- list_targets_by_rule\r\n- put_targets\r\n- remove_targets\r\n- put_events\r\n- put_partner_events\r\n\r\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Implement new provider, and crud API operations. API methods are grouped by resource type and sorted in hierarchical order, each group is sorted alphabetically.\r\n- Implement new dataclass definitions for EventBus and Rule\r\n- Implement service class composing the dataclass for EventBridgeService, RuleService and TargetService, encapsulating related functionality\r\n- A TargetService is instantiated via a base class and a factory containing specific logic in respect to the defined target service\r\n- Added multiple validated AWS tests for basic API functionality validation\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\nNo pattern matching is implemented yet, thus all events are matched to all rules and sed to all targets.\r\n\r\n<!-- The following sections are optional, but can be useful! \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nDescription of how to test the changes\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nArchive: To each Event Bus an Archive can be attached. This adds a Rule to the Event Bus funneling all future Events that match the specified Rule to the respective Archive. To avoid sending events from a replay again to the archive they are replayed from, replayed events have an additional field that is negatively matched against the attached rule. In the Background Events are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket for a specified retention period, allowing you to keep a record of all events that have been processed. Due to optimizing for S3 write events are batched collected over 5-8 minutes and written in batch, therefore it takes at least 5 minutes for an event to end up in an archive.\r\n\r\nReplay: Archived events can be replayed into EventBridge, allowing you to re-process events as if they were happening in real-time. Replays are stored for 90 Days region wide, and no duplicate Replay Names are allowed. Replays cannot be Replayed again.\r\n\r\n- create_archive\r\n- delete_archive\r\n- describe_archive\r\n- update_archive\r\n- list_archives\r\n- cancel_replay\r\n- start_replay\r\n- list_replays\r\n- describe_replay\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\nAdd Archive and replay dataclass in model for persistence and service for methods. \r\nAdding an Archive to an Event Bus automatically attaches a rule to the event bus containing a target required for passing target information to the provider during replay.\r\nStarting a replay queries stored events from the Archive data object and uses the instantiated Replay service object to send the events to event bus.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\nReplay currently only supports replaying to all rules of the event bus the archive is attached to. Replaying to individual rules by providing a list of rule ARNs is currently not supported. \r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n## Testing\r\nAdd tests for archive operations.\r\nAdd fixtures to send events to archive and wait until they are replayable.\r\nAdd tests for archive errors.\r\n\r\nAdd tests for replay operations.\r\nAdd tests for replay errors.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an HTTP request handling framework based on the chain of responsibility pattern, where requests are processed by Handlers that are part of a Handler Chain. This framework replaces the edge proxy, generic proxy, and http2_server.  It provides a clean interface for serving a Gateway (a request -response interface) through ASGI or WSGI.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of LocalStack is implemented in the `LocalstackGateway`, and can be served directly through hypercorn (try `python -m localstack.aws.app` for serving it directly without bootstrapping)\r\n\r\nIt can be enabled by setting `LEGACY_EDGE_PROXY=0`.\r\n\r\nThe current version only works for community. Pro integration will be done in a second iteration (pro test failures are expected). A proper developer documentation will be provided then.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nThe following PRs were the result of the changes developed in this PR.\r\n* #5478 \r\n* #5734\r\n* #5876\r\n* #5970 \r\n* #6040 \r\n* #6006\r\n* #6012\r\n* #6190 \r\n* #6191\r\n* #6192 \r\n* ... and many other fixes and extensions in the asf code, many of which @alexrashed has contributed\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Implement new HTTP request handling (while not breaking the previous functionality).\r\n- [x] Migrate current features of the edge proxy (service detection,...) into separate handlers.\r\n- [x] Fix all community integration tests with the new request handling enabled.\r\n- [x] Hide the new functionality behind a feature flag (opt-in).\r\n- [x] Make the PR smaller by pulling out sub-PRs for dependent changes in master\r\n- [x] Add documentation for the handler chain framework\r\n- [x] Final polishing iteration\r\n- [x] PR review\r\n- [x] change default value of `LEGACY_EDGE_PROXY` back to 1 and run one last test",

I have already fixed almost those issues:\r\n- I just redone 'make format' and 'make lint' to follow the code formatting.\r\n- The apt package for ffmpeg is added. The pip package of ffmpeg seems to be no longer maintained, which is the reason why I choose apt method. And the 'amr' file is still unsupported for the transcription, which requires source code compilation.\r\n- I have added tests for conversions in the test_transcribe.py file.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

So I won't implement this with this PR. \r\n\r\nThat's fine, thank you!\r\nOn a side note (but I think you already hinted at it with your EDIT note): the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventfiltering.html#filtering-sqs) specify that for SQS the body can be any string, but needs to be in a valid JSON if the filter criteria is a JSON-filter - maybe that caused the `InvalidParameterValueException`? \r\n\r\n> Furthermore I added also to raise that `InvalidParameterException`, or at least an Exception, since I didn't know the way to corectly raise an Exception so that it get's parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nFor all [ASF migrated services](https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-04-parity-explained/), using the ServiceException just as you did is the way to go. However, lambda is not yet migrated, and if you check the [code section here](https://github.com/merowinger92/localstack/blob/mk-ddbstreams-filter/localstack/services/awslambda/lambda_api.py#L1707-L1709), it will only correctly parse exceptions of type `ValueError` to an \"error_response\".\r\n\r\nI will add comments directly to the related code. \r\n\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAdd basic support for [composite alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html) evaluation in Cloudwatch. Currently composite alarms can be saved but there is no evaluation for them, therefore there is no way to get them triggered.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nComposite alarm rules will be evaluated now whenever a metric alarm state is changed.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds limited support for alarm rules:\r\n- Alarms can be referred to by ARNs only (no alarm names support yet)\r\n- It is assumed that only OR logic is applied for all child alarms\r\n- Suppression logic for child alarms is not implemented\r\n- Composite alarm actions only support a message to an SNS topic\r\n- Only metric alarms can be child alarms, nesting of a composite ones is not supported yet\r\n\r\nExample of supported rule: `ALARM(\"arn:<partition>:cloudwatch:<region>:111111111111:alarm:<simple-alarm-1-name>\") OR ALARM(\"arn:<partition>:cloudwatch:<region>:111111111111:alarm:<simple-alarm-2-name>\")`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n## Testing\r\nSnapshot tests have been recorded for several test cases to verify that alarm rule logic applies correctly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "This PR refactors SNS publishing and the underlying data model.\r\nThe ASF provider was still making use of the data model used by the `ProxyListener` (using query string parameters).\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the publishing in different class depending on the target: `Lambda`, `SQS`, `Firehose`, `SMS`, `Platform Endpoint` (mobile push notification system), `email`&`email-json`, and `http`/`https`. \r\n\r\nIt makes uses of a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, in the same way as S3 notifications.\r\n\r\nPreviously, while using `publish_batch`, it would send the messages sequentially and synchronously (maybe in order to keep the FIFO order right). This is now all asynchronous.\r\nAlso, while batch publishing to an SQS queue, the new publisher will make use of SQS `SendMessageBatch` instead of making individual calls (the batching size and limitations are the same, so it must use it under the hood).\r\n\r\nDifferent validations were added along the way, for example to `SetSubscriptionAttributes`, and different parameters to `Publish`, with corresponding AWS validated tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've put a feature allowing us to directly publish to the real GCM/FCM mobile notification platform behind a feature flag, for now called `LEGACY_SNS_GCM_PUBLISHING` but maybe in need of a new name. This feature was not advertised, but was blocking some other users as they would need real world credentials to GCM to be able to use LocalStack.\r\n\r\nLimitations: while testing, I've realised that messages sent to FIFO topics would not properly be directed to the DLQ in case of issue, most probably because we don't pass down the `MessageGroupId` and such necessary parameters. This will be treated as the next iteration, an `xfail` test is already in place and I know how to fix the issue, but the PR was getting a bit out of scope. \r\n\r\n_note: CI run failed on a fluke, should be green_\r\n\r\n_fixes #6863_",

      "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe have several parity gaps and bugs in multiple different implementations for [event pattern matching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns-content-based-filtering.html) (see PR https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/10599). We can offer high AWS-parity quickly using the [Amazon EventBridge Event Bus event matching now runs on Open Source Event Ruler v1.5.0](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/amazon-eventbridge-event-bus-matching-event-ruler/) released `event-ruler` Java library from AWS described in [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-sourcing-event-ruler/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Add an experimental opt-in `EVENT_RULE_ENGINE=java` flag using the Java [event-ruler](https://github.com/aws/event-ruler) library from AWS through [JPype](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype).\r\n* Add a `MavenPackageInstaller` utility ~~(could probably move to `localstack/packages/core.py` DONE)~~ \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Set `EVENT_RULE_ENGINE=java`\r\n2. Ensure that `JAVA_HOME` points to a valid JVM installation if you are testing in host mode\r\n3. Uncomment all `SKIP_LABELS` for the test [test_test_event_pattern](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/389d942ac65caf2f824d2ed88fbbe628d1a28b83/tests/aws/services/events/test_event_patterns.py#L87)\r\n4. Run the test `test_test_event_pattern`\r\n\r\n### LocalStack Shutdown\r\n\r\n@dfangl and @joe4dev tested the LocalStack shutdown as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Build LS image using `make docker-build`\r\n2. Start LocalStack using `EVENT_RULE_ENGINE=java DEBUG=1 localstack start`\r\n3. Run a test case for event pattern matching (e.g., `tests.aws.services.events.test_event_patterns.test_test_event_pattern_with_escape_characters) against the running LS instance\r\n4. `docker stop $CONTAINER_ID` should stop the container immediately and not after a 10s delay\r\n\r\n=> worked without delay\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\n* The cross-language call from Python to Java is fast but could add a few milliseconds of delay.\r\n* The tight coupling between Python and Java sharing the same process could crash each others language runtime upon unexpected errors.\r\n* We had to disable the JVM shutdown because LocalStack has too many daemon threads running and JPype only triggers the shutdown after all daemon threads terminated to prevent shutting down the JVM while potentially still in use.\r\n* The arm build failed with `ERROR: Could not build wheels for jpype1` due to `gcc: fatal error: cannot execute \u2018cc1plus\u2019: execvp: No such file or directory`. Supposedly, JPype [only supports up to Python 3.10](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77674837/6875981) \ud83e\udd14, which would be a blocker \ud83d\udd34  (they recently merged a fix for Python 3.12 though). We are using Python 3.11 in the image and jpype1 builds fine on my ARM MacBook using Python 3.11.7.\r\n  * This build error only happened for ARM builds on Linux and required the extra dependency `apt-get install -y g++`.\r\n  * For S3, we had to add this installation step into the make target `docker-run-tests-s3-only` to keep it out of the S3 image.\r\n\r\n### Kinesisanalytics\r\n\r\nKinesisanalytics seems incompatible with `EVENT_RULE_ENGINE=java` indicated by the following [failing tests](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/8734151459/job/23964542786):\r\n- `TestKinesisAnalyticsProvider.test_tag_list_tag_untag_resource`\r\n- `TestKinesisAnalyticsProvider.test_input_processing_configuration`\r\n- `TestKinesisAnalyticsProvider.test_application_output`\r\n- `TestKinesisAnalytics.test_run_siddhi_query`\r\n\r\n\u21d2 all these tests keep failing in the AMD64 pipeline. They are not ARM compatible.\r\n\u21d2 They fail with the assertion: `AssertionError: assert 'STARTING' in ['READY', 'RUNNING']`\r\n\u21d2 The siddhi query test also fails with a name error `NameError: name 't_siddhi_api_core' is not defined` in the Siddhi loader `PySiddhi/SiddhiLoader.py`\r\n\r\nLS uses some badly outdated fork of the unmaintained (5y; LS 3y last commit) PySiddhi project: https://github.com/localstack/PySiddhi. They are using some kind of custom Python\u21d2Java bridge based on JNI, which could cause interference.\r\n\r\n\u2139\ufe0f We decided to ignore this limitation for now. If JPype proves successful, it might be a better alternative than PySiddhi ...\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Switch default `EVENT_RULE_ENGINE` back from `\"java\"` (used for CI testing) to `\"\"`\r\n- [x] https://github.com/localstack/docs/pull/1182\r\n\r\n## Follow Up\r\n\r\n* Fix LS Python-native implementation for `tests.aws.services.lambda_.test_lambda_integration_dynamodbstreams.TestDynamoDBEventSourceMapping.test_dynamodb_event_filter`\r\n  * `numeric_filter` fails due to missing `anything-but` support\r\n  * `exists_false_filter` fails due to broken implementation\r\n  * => It is likely better to adopt Ben's SNS implementation and unify them all because the current status is hardly maintainable.\r\n",

It should reach almost 100% AWS parity. We currently do not yet implement the same complexity calculation, so very complex pattern might work in LocalStack but throw an exception in AWS.\r\nWe are also looking into how to adopt the same rule engine for SNS (which already implements some complexity calculations). //cc @bentsku\r\n\r\nAll builds are \ud83d\udfe2 , so I expect this to be merged anytime soon \ud83d\ude80 ",

Although tests with this java pattern matching take a bit longer to execute for me compared to our own implementation - it is much more complete. I also expect it to perform much better once a certain event number is put through the system at the same time. This will come in handy if we can get the rest of the provider's performance also up that level of speed. ",

Also the `$VENV_DIR` variable was not honoured in the script.\r\n- the hypercorn gateway now takes a list of `HostAndPort` types, which allows binding to multiple addresses\r\n- the `HostAndPort.parse` method is more powerful (i.e. handles parse errors better)\r\n- start the hypercorn gateway for unpriviliged ports and create TCP proxies for priviliged ports, running as sudo if required\r\n- add a special case for our custom json encoder to handle `HostAndPort` instances\r\n",

      "body": "First PR to implement the new S3 native provider not depending on moto. This implements all the basic abstractions, as well as the basic operations around buckets and objects. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of comments left, as it's still WIP, and this introduces only basic behaviour. We will need to implement all the bucket operations to be able to get the complete behaviour from basic operations. \r\n\r\n### List of implemented operations:\r\n- CreateBucket\r\n- DeleteBucket\r\n- ListBuckets\r\n- HeadBucket\r\n- GetBucketLocation\r\n- PutObject\r\n- GetObject\r\n- HeadObject\r\n- DeleteObject\r\n- DeleteObjects\r\n- CopyObject\r\n- ListObjects\r\n- ListObjectsV2\r\n- GetObjectAttributes\r\n- RestoreObject\r\n\r\n## Abstractions\r\n\r\nThis PR implements new abstractions around S3. We are splitting between \"data\", aka the buckets, objects and metadata around them, and the actual file object containing S3 Objects real content. This will allow us to properly split how we save these for persistence in the next iteration. \r\n\r\nWe're introducing a new S3 `BaseStorageBackend` and `TemporaryStorageBackend`, which abstract away how those S3 file objects, which we will name \"assets\", are stored and retrieved. This will in turn allow us to either have a temporary filesystem, or the real filesystem in case of persistence, and give us greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last core Operations and Models outside of Object and Bucket configuration are the multipart, coming in #8787\r\n\r\nThere a lot of bugs regarding the versioning code path, because it couldn't be tested before I could enable versioning on the bucket, which is now done and is fixed with #8799.

      "body": "This is a first draft to introduce file streaming in S3, and never load the request data fully in memory.\r\n\r\nThis cannot work without some changes to the `S3_DIR` patching, and minimal changes in moto-ext (PR here: https://github.com/localstack/moto/pull/67). \r\n\r\nPreliminary tests shows that the RAM usage is much lower when putting big objects and especially when completing multipart uploads. \r\n\r\nWe would have an S3 provider dedicated for streaming requests through heavy patching of moto internal. We also need to interweave moto logic within our provider operations, as we cannot pass a stream to moto where it would read the entire content in memory.\r\n\r\nA multithreading issue surfaced when issuing range requests via `download_fileobj`, the underlying client will spawn multiple threads requesting different parts of the object simultaneously, which messed up the access to the underlying stream via `seek`. I've introduced a locking mechanism with the `SynchronizedDefaultDict` using the underlying stream `id` as we don't always have access to the container `StreamedFakeKey` object in moto, however it means that it is now slower. Not sure what mechanism we could use here without duplicating the stream or reading the whole range in memory at once. \r\n\r\nThis PR would also provider a fix for #6659 and #6845 at the same time.

I (@SwatsonCodes) realized we were working on closely related features (on-failure destination and TRIM_HORIZON starting position for lambda event source mappings), but since my work involved a significant refactor of the existing kinesis event source code whoever merged their code first would force the other person to entirely re-work their implementation. Therefore at @thrau 's advice I decided to start pushing my work to Steffy's branch, resulting in this very large PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n* Refactor the base `EventSourceListener` abstract class into its own file\r\n* Move the `SQSEventSourceListener` class into its own file (and rename it slightly)\r\n* Refactor the DynamoDB Stream and Kinesis event source logic to use the EventSourceListener class\r\n* Leverage this refactored logic to implement the TRIM_HORIZON starting position for Kinesis and DynamoDB event sources\r\n* Add \"on failure destination\" implementation for DynamoDB and Kinesis event source mappings.\r\n* Refactor `lambda_integration.py` for general code organization and readability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal PR message from @steffyP :\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdded functionality for `create-event-source-mapping` with `DestinationConfig`:\r\n* AWS only supports `DestinationConfig` for streams, and only  `OnFailure`\r\n* This `DestinationConfig` is independent from the configuration in `put_function_event_invoke_config`\r\n\r\n### In this PR:\r\n- Implemented `OnFailure` invocation when using Kinesis Stream + Dynamodb Streams in `create-event-source-mapping`\r\n- For Dynamodb Streams that forwards to Kinesis Stream: let Kinesis invoke the lambda, as it has relevant information required for the `OnFailure` callback\r\n- Added test cases (that work against AWS + LocalStack)\r\n\r\n### Some observations (not part of this PR):\r\n* AWS validates the input of DestinationConfig extensively:\r\n  * throws an error if `OnSuccess` is used -> LocalStack will allow the creation, but will only act for `OnFailure`\r\n  * throws an error if the event source is not a stream, and `DestinationConfig` is set -> LS will allow creation (but only act for streams e.g. kinesis, dynamodb)\r\n  * only allows SQS/SNS as a destination for `OnFailure` -> LS does not validate, and will allow any destination\r\n* `put_function_event_invoke_config` seems only to invoke `DestinationConfig` on AWS if it was started asynchronously, and only if it is not triggered by event source mapping. LocalStack currently invokes it for every run, but changing this might be a risk.\r\n```",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR adds pattern matching to distribute incoming events based on event bus specified in the event, rules in the matching event bus and matches the patterns in the rules. \r\nIt uses the existing rule matching algorithm from v1, which is limited, e.g. patterns with `anything but` or `exists = True`. \r\n\r\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\r\n## Changes\r\nAdd parsing for event pattern to a dictionary, and add validating of pattern.\r\nAdd correct formatting of events and add additional keys. \r\nAdd API method to test event pattern using same matching algorithm as for distributing events to targets.\r\nRemove skip markers from now passing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nSet the env variable `PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_EVENTS=v2` and run tests in events folder. All unsupported tests have the appropriate skip markers. \r\n\r\n<!-- The following sections are optional, but can be useful! \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of how to test the changes\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",

Maybe it's causing compile issues on Arm? What's interesting is the tests will run locally on my M1 mac build so maybe an available CPU/memory issue? I'm open to thoughts.",

          "body": "> Hi @chezsmithy - thanks again so much for your hard work on this PR. We'd be happy to jump in and help out with the remaining issues (e.g., test failures). Do you think you could give us push access to your fork, so we can collaborate on your branch? Thanks! \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\nYou should have access now. I've added in a new Dockerfile called Dockerfile.complete-debian. It's based off of Debian buster python 3.8. Build times are greatly improved for arm. Also, it has stabilized my test runs. Likely this is due to having glibc included. I wonder if it might make sense to use this rather than alpine as the base? Thoughts?",

That's quite some heavy lifting with the different archs, qemu, buildx,...\r\n\r\nI started working on this on Friday. First thing was to fix the base image build's ES plugin installations (which was broken due to changes to their webserver's cipher suite, which in turn weren't supported in our stripped down JRE). This actually had nothing to do with this PR, but was basically a prerequisite to get started.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm working on getting the multiarch alpine base image build working for me, because we would actually try to stick with alpine if that's possible. We really want to keep things as small and fast as possible, and therefore we really want to avoid the additional 310 MB of the Debian image.\r\n\r\nWe could also short-circuit in our community Slack to join forces if you would like to.",

That's quite some heavy lifting with the different archs, qemu, buildx,...\n> \n> \n> \n> I started working on this on Friday. First thing was to fix the base image build's ES plugin installations (which was broken due to changes to their webserver's cipher suite, which in turn weren't supported in our stripped down JRE). This actually had nothing to do with this PR, but was basically a prerequisite to get started.\n> \n> \n> \n> Currently I'm working on getting the multiarch alpine base image build working for me, because we would actually try to stick with alpine if that's possible. We really want to keep things as small and fast as possible, and therefore we really want to avoid the additional 310 MB of the Debian image.\n> \n> \n> \n> We could also short-circuit in our community Slack to join forces if you would like to.\n\nThanks! Not many changes in the end, but it's got a few moving parts to it. It might be worth considering Debian, just for the benefit of your python code build times. On alpine, with musl it appears may of the wheels need to be built from scratch extending the docker build time. With Debian and glibc only a few need to build making it much faster. I have both docker files so you can compare and see. Love to work with you on slack.",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR allows for the ESM poller to collect and send batches of SQS messages based on the number of messages collected and the duration of the batching event (up to 300s).\r\n\r\nThe motivations were as follows:\r\n1. The feature request https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/5042 required LocalStack to support batch size over 10, which in turn would depend on [MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-eventsourcemapping.html#cfn-lambda-eventsourcemapping-maximumbatchingwindowinseconds) being larger than 1. While offering CRUD support for this parameter, LocalStack did not actually collect a batch for the specified duration. Hence, these functional changes mean that we can now collect records until the window elapses.\r\n\r\n2. Under high volumes of requests, we expect the latency of LocalStack's gateway to degrade due. By supporting window batching, we have also introduced the ability for ESM pollers to long-poll an SQS event source for batches of data -- which should help alleviate some pressure on the gateway. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Adds long-polling for SQS ReceiveMessage that will continuously poll an SQS queue until either a desired number of messages BatchSize has been collected or the minimum between MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds has elapsed.\r\n- Once collected, this batch is potentially further split into chunks of up to 2.5K records each in lieu of proper flushing based on Lambda payload quotas (see [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.html#invocation-eventsourcemapping-batching)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Unskips the `test_sqs_event_source_mapping_batching_reserved_concurrency` since we can now collect and send batches of more than 10 records at a time.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarking\r\n\r\nSome benchmarks were run to assess how the long-polling changes would the latency of the LocalStack gateway. See benchmarking results [here](https://github.com/localstack/locust-benchmarking/tree/experiment/long-polling/experiments/long_polling_esm_sqs).\r\n\r\ntl;dr Long polling saw fewer requests being made and, in some cases, had improved latencies at higher percentiles `P(>95)`.\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\n- A higher load on the gateway means fewer available threads for processing new requests. Therefore, we'd expect short-polling calls with many poll-misses to add unnecessary load to the gateway (due to each processing call requiring a worker) that equivalent long-polling calls should be able to circumvent.\r\n- We poll an event source at an interval of once per second. Each long-polling call will block a single gateway thread (there are 1K available) while waiting for a request to complete. Therefore, we expect that (in extremis) many ESM pollers all running long-polling calls will cause resource contention and degrade performance.\r\n- For most cases, however, we assume that long-polling calls should reduce the number of requests made to the gateway within a given duration, therefore improving the availability of workers to process _other_ requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n- Performance with and without long polling was fairly similar in terms of latency across all experiments, with differences of between 50-300ms between the two approaches.\r\n- Large batch sizes coupled with high batch windows saw the largest improvements in performance.\r\n- Long polling resulted in fewer requests (`~7%`) being processed within the 5m test interval - likely due to high resource contention while long-polling calls were being made. However, this did not hold true for maximising Batch Size (`10k`) and Batch Window (`300s`) with long-polling which saw the highest throughput and best latency improvements.\r\n\r\n### Conclusions\r\n\r\n- The effects of long-polling were sometimes seen at higher latency percentiles -- where long polling runs had less latency than short polling. However, no notable changes in performance were observed between long and short polling.\r\n- Performance was optimized in both cases by using larger batch sizes and longer batch windows, with the combination of long polling + large batches + long windows showing the best overall efficiency.\r\n- Importantly, while introducing long-polling did not dramatically effect performance (positively or negatively), this provides LocalStack with an avenue for optimising  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The main issue was that we ran out of gateway threads, significantly reducing performance, and general resource starvation.\r\n\r\nI am not sure we face the same problem here, (as we effectively blocked one gateway thread per lambda function before, now per ESM), and if twisted reacts better here than hypercorn.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think this poses the potential for a problem, but it might be fine. We would need to do some tests with very high counts of ESM on different machines, to see how it impacts the performance of the gateway.",

For example: `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT_TIMEOUT=30` (default is 10 seconds)\r\n\r\nTo mitigate startup delays, we recommend adding the following volume mount for caching (see [Installation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#starting-localstack-with-docker-compose)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - \"${LOCALSTACK_VOLUME_DIR:-./volume}:/var/lib/localstack\"\r\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also try to pull the latest image `docker pull localstack/localstack-pro` because we recently started shipping the lambda runtime init, an asset that was previously downloaded lazily.\r\nThe used Lambda images can also be updated through our CLI using `localstack update all`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI: We are going to ship another improvement in the coming weeks that will prevent the infinite re-try loop in this case.\r\n",

Can you please pull the latest Docker image and try again with debug logs enabled using `DEBUG=1`?\r\n\r\nThe root cause is likely something else but our latest version hopefully helps to debug the issue quicker \ud83d\udcc8 \r\n",

This is likely a Docker networking issue. Please ensure that Lambda containers are in the same network as the LocalStack container. Notice that `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK` does currently not support `host` mode.\r\n\r\nHow do you start LocalStack? Feel free to share your LocalStack configuration (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`) for feedback.",

Does it work for others in your team with \"Rancher Desktop\", \"x86_64\", \"macOs 14.0\"? I am trying to understand what's the distinguishing factor here.\r\n\r\nIs there a specific reason you need `hostname: localstack` in the docker-compose?\r\n\r\nI noticed in the initial LocalStack logs that the Lambda functions uses the network `'network': 'nodejs_default'`. Did you configure a specific network?",

Not sure if supporting ARM is a realistic option at this point, given our set of dependencies, but would be great to get an initial understanding of the complexity of such an undertaking. Do you think you could give it a try and create some initial experiments to see if ARM can be realistically supported in the future? That would be highly appreciated - thanks!",

I tweaked the localstack KMS installer to use that binary, and saw that it worked. I plan on reaching out to the local-kms project owner to see if he's willing to host an ARM-compatible binary.\r\n- Regarding the Dockerfile, I'm thinking to leverage multi-stage builds so that the Docker build can support both x86_64 and aarch64 ~create an aarch64-specific version based off the current one, then update the makefile to check the CPU architecture and select between the ARM file or the x86 (current base) file~.\r\n\r\nAfter that, it all worked (see below).\r\n\r\n@whummer If you're ok with accepting a PR for ARM support, I see the following as the action items:\r\n\r\n1. local-kms - Ask the project owner if he wants to host an ARM binary, or generate one and host it somewhere.\r\n2.

      "body": "<!-- Please refer to the contribution guidelines before raising a PR: https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Why am I raising this PR? Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe existing Counter implementation follows a parsing-based approach, relying on metric name patterns like label1:label2:* and inferring implicit relationships through JSON structures, dictionaries, or other nested data formats. Since these structures can vary depending on the feature or how each feature owner decides to implement them, querying, filtering, and aggregating metrics become inconsistent and complex. This lack of explicit structure makes it harder to standardize analysis across different use cases.\r\n\r\nThis refactor introduces a structured and extensible approach to metric collection, enforcing clear label standards and dimensional analysis while making all relationships and classifications explicit, rather than relying on naming conventions, positional placement, or nested JSON structures. By ensuring consistency, we can simplify querying, filtering, and aggregations, making analytics more scalable and reducing the need for custom metric handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Moved metrics to `metrics.py`, making them a standalone concept, not strictly tied to `usage.py`.\r\n- Introduced `MetricRegistry` as a singleton for managing all registered metrics (Counters, Gauges, etc.).\r\n- Introduced `Metric` as the base interface for metrics, enforcing the implementation of the `collect()` method in all metric types (e.g., Counters, Gauges).\r\n- Updated published event name from `ls:usage` to `ls_metrics`\r\n- Set a limit of 8 labels per metric to ensure labels are used effectively as dimensions for time-series analysis, filtering, and aggregations, preventing misuse or unnecessary complexity. A dedicated guide will follow to outline best practices.\r\n\r\n### Usage Examples\r\n**Basic Counter**\r\nA Counter tracks the occurrences of an event. It can be used without labels for simple counting:\r\n```\r\nfrom localstack.utils.analytics.metrics import Counter\r\n\r\n# Define a counter\r\nhttp_responses = Counter(namespace=\"http\", name=\"requests\")\r\n\r\n# Increment\r\nhttp_responses.increment()\r\nhttp_responses.increment(value=3)\r\n\r\n# Reset\r\nhttp_responses.reset()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Counters with Labels**\r\nCounters can include labels to categorize events more effectively:\r\n```\r\nfrom localstack.utils.analytics.metrics import Counter\r\n\r\n# Define a counter with labels\r\nchaos_invocations = Counter(namespace=\"chaos\", name=\"invocations\", labels=[\"operation\"])\r\n\r\n# Increment\r\nchaos_invocations.labels(operation=\"fault\").increment(value=3)\r\nchaos_invocations.labels(operation=\"network-effect\").increment(value=4)\r\n\r\n# Reset\r\nchaos_invocations.labels(operation=\"fault\").reset()\r\nchaos_invocations.labels(operation=\"network-effect\").reset()\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n## Testing\r\n### Unit Tests (No External Services Required)  \r\n- The test suite includes **unit tests** that validate metric collection and registry behavior **without requiring event publishing** to the analytics backend.  \r\n\r\n### End-to-End Testing with the Analytics Backend\r\nFor a more in-depth test, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run the Analytics Backend Locally\r\n- Start the analytics backend to capture and process metric events.\r\n- Ensure that environment variables are correctly set to send events to the data platform.\r\n\r\n2. Start LocalStack Core with Analytics Enabled\r\n- Start LocalStack Core with the appropriate environment variables to enable analytics and send events to the local backend:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nANALYTICS_API=\"http://localhost:8000/v1\" \\\r\nDEBUG=1 \\\r\nDEBUG_ANALYTICS=1 \\\r\npython -m localstack.cli.main start --host\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [X] Instrument Chaos API - [PR](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/pull/4076).\r\n- [X] Complete internal documentation on best practices for metrics and label naming",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nImplement priority and action filtering for the `ListFirewallRules` operation in Route 53 Resolver\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\nAdded functionality to filter by `action` and `priority` for the Route53Resolver operation ListFirewallRules.\r\n\r\nAdditionally fixed a bug during which: listing a firewall-rule-group for which no rules were created resulted in a ResourceNotFoundException. This was because the store object for firewall-rules was only created when the 1st rule was added.\r\nThis change lifts creating a store space for firewall-rules at the firewall-rule-group creation.\r\n\r\nParity tests were included for:\r\n- test listing firewall rules for a non-existing rule-group.\r\n- test listing firewall rules for empty rule-group\r\n- test listing all rules in the rule-group\r\n- test listing rules filtered by priority\r\n- test listing rules filtered by action\r\n- test listing rules filtered by priority and action\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nNow that the new S3 provider is out and does not have any dependencies on Moto, we wanted to get an S3-only LocalStack image, which would try to be slimmed down as much as we could without major changes to the code base.\r\n\r\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- create a new `Dockerfile.s3` to build a slim LocalStack image with almost no dependencies\r\n- create a new GH Actions pipeline to test the image when changes in the core framework or S3 are made, and to manually publish it via a workflow dispatch.\r\n- Check for Moto import and try to scope them inside patch functions\r\n- modify providers to import the `MotoFallbackDispatcher` inside the plugin, as some other providers were doing, and not a global import.\r\n- remove an SQS old util not used anymore, which imported Moto in `sqs/utils` which is used in the service router, imported globally\r\n- split the S3 utils between regular and Moto ones for the legacy provider\r\n- do conditional imports for legacy S3 needs in `s3/notifications.py`\r\n- move a fixture importing Moto into the specific test file needing them `test_inspect.py`\r\n- add a workaround for `account_id`/`region` fixture (needed for snapshot testing) when `sts` is not enabled and in LocalStack. \\cc @dominikschubert I would like to have your input on this\r\n- add `skipif` for S3 tests for tests depending on other services\r\n\r\nFor the PR to be ready to push to the regular LocalStack repo with the `localstack/localstack:latest-s3` image name and tag, we just need to change the value of `DOCKERHUB_IMAGE_NAME` in `.github/workflows/tests-s3-image.yml`, and change pack the push to Dockerhub to be only when done manually.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\nThe S3 image does not contain:\r\n- the global awslocal installation inside the container\r\n- the DNS server to gain some size, but this could be added back if there's a need (it's started with `DNS_ADDRESS=false`)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThis was a test run with pushing enabled to a test repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/localstack/localstack/actions/runs/6972644488\r\nThe image is available with `docker pull localstack/localstack-s3-test:latest-s3`, build 23/11/23 around 18:30\r\nAnd last test run:\r\nhttps://github.com/localstack/localstack/actions/runs/6981817553?pr=9712\r\nImage is available with `docker pull localstack/localstack:s3-latest`. \r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack/tags\r\n\r\nThe -ext pipeline was green except for some flake on ARM. \r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] find a way to have node inside the S3 image during testing for the InfraProvisioner fixture, or a way to not load it\r\n- [x] should we create a new docker-save-image make target with gzip?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "## Motivation\r\nThis PR aims at cleaning up after the quick fixes with the protocol switch in SQS of `botocore` from `query` to `json` (and now back again).\r\n\r\nThese changes of the protocol are highly problematic, because this means that clients are suddenly changing the way how they talk to AWS (and in turn also with LocalStack). There's nothing we can do on our side besides implementing the new protocol (in addition to the old protocol to remain downwards-compatible with other or older clients).\r\n\r\nHere's a timeline of what happened:\r\n- **2023-05-04** - `botocore` switched the protocol for SQS from `query` to `json` in version [`1.29.127`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/releases/tag/1.29.127) (specifically this commit: https://github.com/boto/botocore/commit/2395012bd369f89b0bcfbbf830718866fc6ae166).\r\n  - The changes were quickly hitting LocalStack users: https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/8267\r\n- **2023-05-05** - `botocore` reverts the change with https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/2931 in version [`1.29.128`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/releases/tag/1.29.128).\r\n- **2023-11-09** - `botocore` again performs the switch in version [`1.31.81`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/releases/tag/1.31.81) (specifically this commit: https://github.com/boto/botocore/commit/84c784761d4cde0c0ce3b2b32382f970d23b3cc8).\r\n- **2023-11-11** - Two days after the switch, we were ready with a somewhat hacky solution: https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/8268\r\n  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9607 - Performs a quick cleanup after the initial merge of the new protocol support.\r\n  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9634 - Fixes an issue in the routing\r\n  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9611 - Adjusts the ASF specs and the provider implementation accordingly\r\n  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9709 - Removes the artificial service from the list of services in the health endpoint\r\n- **2023-11-11** - `botocore` changes the exception handling for SQS in version [`1.31.85`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/releases/tag/1.31.85) in https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/3054.\r\n  - These changes have been addressed with https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9627.\r\n- **2023-11-15** - `botocore` switches to gzipped specs which is not compatible with moto at the time.\r\n  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/commit/815d6c77245e3ebfb9d298a70fe16bd12df032f7 pins `botocore` as a first response.\r\n- **2023-11-22** - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9624 upgrades `moto` such that it contains https://github.com/getmoto/moto/pull/7030.\r\n- **2023-11-22** - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9667 unpins `botocore` again\r\n- **2023-11-22** - `botocore` switches the protocol for SQS back from `json` to `query` in version [`1.32.6`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/releases/tag/1.32.6) (specifically this PR: https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/3071)\r\n  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9714 pins `botocore` as a first response.\r\n\r\nThis is where we are at. With this PR we want to:\r\n- [x] Get rid of the artificial \"sqs-query\" service. The term `sqs-query` should only be used in very specific sections explicitly handling the `query` spec.\r\n- [x] Remove the pin on `botocore`, effectively switching back to `query` as the default protocol, but still support `json`.\r\n- [x] Remove the pin of AWS CLI in the `Dockerfile` introduced with https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9767.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- The first commit cleans up after the previous efforts to adjust to the chaotic changes around the protocol changes in SQS.\r\n  - This change centers around switching from differentiating the requests on protocol level, rather than on service level.\r\n  - It removes the `sqs-query` service \"alias\", and removes all special cases handling this service alias.\r\n  - It adjusts the `serializer` and `parser` such that they differentiate based on the protocol of the given service model (instead of only based on the service).\r\n  - It adjusts the `service_router` such that it delivers a service model instead of only the service name (because that would be ambiguous, there are two service models for SQS).\r\n- The second commit upgrades the ASF API stubs based on the latest `botocore` version (since they had to be hold back, see https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9735).\r\n- The third commit actually performs the upgrade / unpinning of `botocore`.\r\n  - This means another switch from `json` back to `query` as default protocol for SQS.\r\n  - The internalized spec for SQS is switched from `query` to `json` (the \"non-default\" protocol).\r\n  - Changes the `serializer` adjustments which are necessary due to the duality of the protocols, their divergence, and the fact that we only generate a single ASF stub based on one of the specs.\r\n  - Adjusts the SQS provider to some recent changes (empty lists / dicts are not contained anymore in certain cases, like messages or tags).\r\n  - Fixes / updates quite a lot of tests and snapshots.\r\n    - Also parameterizes most of the SQS tests such that they are snapshot tested against both protocols.\r\n- The fourth commit contains some test fixes related to the new changes in the S3 specs / generated code. /cc @bentsku ",

It was dynamodb. A put() takes up to half a second. \n\nAfter swapping in an image of dynalite, dynamodb calls became 3-10x times faster (!). What was the original reason for switching to dynamodb local?\n\nmy setup:\n\nlocalstack: 0.8.7 and 0.9.0 (dockerized)\nos: macOS 10.14.2\ndocker for mac: 2.0.0.3\n\ndynalite image built from the one in this [PR](https://github.com/mhart/dynalite/pull/104) to dynalite\n\n\n\n\u2506Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Bug](https://localstack.atlassian.net/browse/LOC-91) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io/learn-more)\n",

I think the performance analysis should rather focus on the overhead that the LocalStack proxy server is adding. We may be able to perform some caching of API calls, etc. in some places.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the integration between DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams (forwarding PutItem calls in DynamoDB to corresponding streams) could be the culprit here - should be a good starting point for investigation.",

But I still think it may be good idea to make them distinct. Internal clients use the preset 'internal' credentials but external clients must be explicit about auth credentials and region. Thoughts?\r\n- Improve the caching efficiency even more as the DTO injection is decoupled from the client.\r\n- The `_` params will not conflict with Boto API operation params\r\n\r\n> do we have an idea of how many clients are cached after, for example, the integration test suite has run through?\r\n\r\nNot at this time, we'll need to completely replace `aws_stack` to find out.",

The throttling/rate limiting will likely be refactored over time - should become a shared utility that can also be plugged into other services (e.g., Kinesis, etc)",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nDifferent failure context payloads in ESM and pipes require that we accommodate for both scenarios. This PR makes the context generation an abstract method that classes implementing the `EventsProcessor` interface will have to define.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### `EventsProcessor` and context generation changes\r\n- Add abstract `generate_event_failure_context` to `EventsProcessor` interface.\r\n- Define `generate_event_failure_context` for ESM, returning a `requestContext` and `responseContext` on failure.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions and error handling\r\n- Add error context field to `BatchFailureError` exception.\r\n- Pass and use error contexts for `requestContext` and `responseContext` generation via `SenderError`, `PartialFailureSenderError`, and `BatchFailureError`.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n- Correct timestamp formatting for DynamoDB (without milliseconds) and Kinesis (with miliseconds).\r\n- Added several inline `TODOs` for future refactoring/implementation improvements.\r\n- Removed some snapshot verification skipping for ESM v2.\r\n- Regenerated all ESM snapshots and added `conftest.py` to allow better timestamp transforming in the `event_source_mapping` subdir.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe below tests have been validated following these changes. In addition, `requestContext` and `responseContext` are no longer skipped from snapshot matching.\r\n- Kinesis: `TestKinesisSource::test_kinesis_event_source_mapping_with_on_failure_destination_config`\r\n- DynamoDB: `TestDynamoDBEventSourceMapping::test_dynamodb_event_source_mapping_with_on_failure_destination_config`\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "This PR generalizes the ideas of #4497 into a framework for writing plugins in LocalStack.\r\n\r\n## Core concepts\r\n\r\n* `PluginSpec`: describes a `Plugin`. Each plugin has a namespace, a unique name in that namespace, and a `PluginFactory` (something that creates `Plugin` the spec is describing. In the simplest case, that can just be the Plugin's class).\r\n* `Plugin`: an object that exposes a `should_load` and `load` method. note that it does not function as a domain object (it does not hold the plugins lifecycle state, like initialized, loaded, etc..., or other metadata of the Plugin)\r\n* `PluginFinder`: finds plugins, either at build time (by scanning the modules using `pkgutil` and `setuptools`) or at run time (reading entrypoints of the distribution using [stevedore](https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/))\r\n* `PluginManager`: manages the run time lifecycle of a Plugin, which has three states:\r\n  * resolved: the entrypoint pointing to the PluginSpec was imported and the `PluginSpec` instance was created\r\n  * init: the `PluginFactory` of the `PluginSpec` was successfully invoked\r\n  * loaded: the `load` method of the `Plugin` was successfully invoked\r\n\r\n## Build time vs run time\r\n\r\nAt build time (`make entrypoints` or `python setup.py develop/install`), a special `PluginFinder` collects anything that can be interpreted as a `PluginSpec`, and creates from it setuptools entrypoints. in the `setup.py` we can use the `localstack.plugin.entrypoint.find_plugins` method to collect a dictionary for the `entry_points` value of `setup()`.\r\n\r\nAt run time, a `PluginManager` uses a `PluginFinder` that in turn uses stevedore to scan the available entrypoints for things that look like a`PluginSpec`. with `PluginManager.load(name: str)` or `PluginManager.load_all()`, plugins within the namespace that are discoverable in entrypoints can be loaded. If an error occurs at any state of the lifecycle, the `PluginManager` informs the `PluginLifecycleListener` about it, but continues operating.\r\n\r\n## Creating a system using the plugin framework\r\n\r\nThe framework itself does not have immediate impact on anything in the codebase yet, but provides powerfull tools to restructure existing systems (like we did in #4497, or `localstack.services`).\r\n\r\nTo build something using the plugin framework, you will first want to introduce a Plugin that does something when it is loaded. And then, at runtime, you need a component that uses the `PluginManager` to get those plugins.\r\n\r\n### One class per plugin\r\n\r\nThis is the way we went with `LocalstackCliPlugin`. Every plugin class (e.g., `ProCliPlugin`) is essentially a singleton. This is easy as the classes are discoverable as plugins. Simply create a plugin class with a name and namespace and it will be discovered by the build time `PluginFinder`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# abstract case (not discovered at build time, missing name)\r\nclass CliPlugin(Plugin):\r\n    namespace = \"my.plugins.cli\"\r\n\r\n    def load(self, cli):\r\n        self.attach(cli)\r\n\r\n    def attach(self, cli):\r\n        raise NotImplementedError\r\n\r\n# discovered at build time (has a namespace, name, and is a Plugin)\r\nclass MyCliPlugin(CliPlugin):\r\n    name = \"my\"\r\n\r\n    def attach(self, cli):\r\n        # ... attach commands to cli object\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow we need a `PluginManager` (which has a generic type) to load the plugins for us:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncli = #... needs to come from somewhere\r\n\r\nmanager: PluginManager[CliPlugin] = PluginManager(\"my.plugins.cli\", load_args=(cli,))\r\n\r\nplugins: List[CliPlugin] = manager.load_all()\r\n\r\n# todo: do stuff with the plugins, if you want/need\r\n#  in this example, we simply use the plugin mechanism to run a one-shot function (attach) on a load argument\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Re-usable plugins\r\n\r\nWhen you have lots of plugins that are structured in a similar way, we may not want to create a separate Plugin class for each plugin. Instead we want to use the same `Plugin` class to do the same thing, but use several instances of it. The `PluginFactory`, and the fact that `PluginSpec` instances defined at module level are discoverable (inpired by [pluggy](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy)), can be used to achieve that.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass ServicePlugin(Plugin):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, service_name):\r\n      self.service_name = service_name\r\n      self.service = None\r\n\r\n    def should_load(self):\r\n        return self.service_name in config.SERVICES:\r\n\r\n    def load(self):\r\n        module = importlib.import_module(\"localstack.services.%s\" % self.service_name)\r\n        # suppose we define a convention that each service module has a Service class, like moto's `Backend`\r\n        self.service = module.Service()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef service_plugin_factory(name) -> PluginFactory:\r\n    def create():\r\n        return ServicePlugin(name)\r\n\r\n    return create\r\n\r\n# discoverable\r\ns3 = PluginSpec(\"localstack.plugins.services\", \"s3\", service_plugin_factory(\"s3\"))\r\n\r\n# discoverable\r\ndynamodb = PluginSpec(\"localstack.plugins.services\", \"dynamodb\", service_plugin_factory(\"dynamodb\"))\r\n\r\n# ... could be simplified with convenience framework code, but the principle will stay the same\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we could use the `PluginManager` to build a Supervisor\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass Supervisor:\r\n    manager: PluginManager[ServicePlugin]\r\n\r\n    def start(self, service_name):\r\n      plugin = manager.load(service_name)\r\n      service = plugin.service\r\n      service.start()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are just some examples, and depending on the type of code we will write using the framework in the future, we can introduce new concepts that will reduce boilerplate code.\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR introduces basic support for the Amazon EventBridge API Gateway target within LocalStack's new EventBridge v2 implementation. The primary goal is to enable the successful delivery of events from an EventBridge bus to an API Gateway endpoint, ensuring parity with AWS's behavior through comprehensive testing.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Implementation of `ApiGatewayTargetSender` Class:**\r\n  - Parses the API Gateway ARN to extract `api_id`, `stage_name`, `http_method`, and `resource_path`.\r\n  - Dynamically replaces wildcards (`*`) in the resource path with provided `PathParameterValues`, allowing flexible URL construction.\r\n  - Constructs the API Gateway endpoint URL using `config.internal_service_url()` and sets the appropriate `Host` header for proper routing within LocalStack.\r\n  - Utilizes the Python `requests` library to send serialized JSON events to the API Gateway endpoint with a 5-second timeout.\r\n  - Excludes prohibited HTTP headers and ensures necessary headers like `Content-Type` are set.\r\n  - Implements error handling and logging for failed HTTP requests and exceptions.\r\n\r\n- **Parity Test Addition:**\r\n  - Added a parity test in `tests/aws/services/events/test_events_targets.py` to validate the integration between EventBridge and API Gateway.\r\n  - The test sets up AWS resources (Lambda function, API Gateway, EventBridge rule), sends an event, and verifies that the Lambda function receives the correct payload via API Gateway.\r\n  - Generated a snapshot capturing all essential interactions and responses, ensuring LocalStack's behavior matches AWS's expected outcomes with appropriate redactions.\r\n\r\n- **Configuration Adjustments:**\r\n  - Ensured LocalStack is started with the `PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_EVENTS=v2` environment variable to opt into the new EventBridge v2 implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n## Testing\r\n1. **Set Up LocalStack:**\r\n   - Start LocalStack with EventBridge v2 enabled:\r\n     ```bash\r\n     make clean\r\n     make install\r\n     PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_EVENTS=v2 make start\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n2. **Run Parity Test:**\r\n   - Execute the parity test to verify the implementation:\r\n     ```bash\r\n     PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_EVENTS=v2 WARN=1 make test TEST_PATH=tests/aws/services/events/test_events_targets.py::TestEventsTargetApiGateway::test_put_events_with_target_api_gateway\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n3. **Verify Snapshot:**\r\n   - Ensure the generated snapshot accurately reflects the expected AWS behavior and that all sensitive fields are appropriately redacted.\r\n\r\n4. **Generating Snapshot (Optional):**\r\n```bash\r\nmake test TEST_PATH=\"tests/aws/services/events/test_events_targets.py::TestEventsTargetApiGateway::test_put_events_with_target_api_gateway\" TEST_TARGET=AWS_CLOUD SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 AWS_PROFILE=ls-sandbox PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_EVENTS=v2\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n## TODO\r\n- [ ] Update inline documentation and comments within the code for clarity.\r\n- [ ] Add validations for input.\r\n- [ ] Add retrying logic\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nCurrently the StepFunctions V2 provider does not support the newly introduced AWS Api Action <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_TestState.html\" target=\"_blank\">TestState</a>. This PR adds base support of such action to both the provider and interpreter.\r\n\r\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Introduced minimal StaticAnalyser workflow to walk the program's AST and raise errors: used to detect unsupported language features for TestState derivations\r\n- Added a new Preprocessor to map the ASL's AST to the TestState evaluations components\r\n- Added a new TestStateProgram for evaluating single state\r\n- Added a new Environment type TestStateEnvironment to allow evaluation components to log debug/trace data during execution\r\n- Added relevant aspects to evaluation components to use the TestStateEnvironment to log their outputs\r\n- Added various Execution components to allow the provider to dispatch TestState executions\r\n- Other related changes\r\n- Added tests suite for all tracing scenarios for each supported state type \r\n\r\n\\*\\* The conversion of TestState Static Analysers' failures into StepFunctions InvalidDefinition errors will be introduced in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- The following sections are optional, but can be useful! \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nDescription of how to test the changes\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",

The test creation fails due to the missing declaration of path parameters as required. I would actually consider this as a bug in the specs (since this would also fail when using the command in boto or the AWS CLI without the param?).\r\n\r\nConcerning the locking: Unfortunately, locking dependencies has quite an impact, that's not something we can do within this PR.",

I can get the multiple containers up and running from a clean configuration, but encounter problems after restarting. I encountered the problems when using services sqs+dynamodb.\r\n\r\nReproduced with localstack/localstack 0.12.5 and latest. \r\nmacOS Catalina 10.15.7\r\nDocker Engine v20.10.2\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is some additional logging I can supply, or if I should try for a minimal reproduction with a manual copy of a problematic `recorded_api_calls.json` file. \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nConsistently able to launch services, multiple times.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOn the second launch, so the persistent data volume has contents, localstack does not come up and displays:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWaiting for all LocalStack services to be ready\r\nWaiting for all LocalStack services to be ready\r\nWaiting for all LocalStack services to be ready\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAfter the failure occurs (when I also had dynamodb enabled), the problem can be reproduced with just sqs and launching using a simple `docker-compose.yml` file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '2.4'\r\nservices:\r\n  localstack:\r\n    image: localstack/localstack:latest\r\n    environment:\r\n      - SERVICES=sqs\r\n      - DATA_DIR=/mnt/data\r\n    ports:\r\n      - '4566:4566'\r\n    volumes:\r\n      # Persistent data\r\n      - type: volume\r\n        source: localstack-data\r\n        target: /mnt/data\r\nvolumes:\r\n  localstack-data:\r\n```\r\n\r\nLaunch with `docker-compose up localstack` loops indefinitely waiting for services to be ready.\r\n\r\nConnecting to the container and deleting `recorded_api_calls.json` from `DATA_DIR` fixes the problem for the next launch.\r\n\r\n## Command used to start LocalStack\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose up \r\n```\r\n",

This is actually fairly simillar to the AWS behavior since they also have some initial \"optimization\" of Lambdas when creating a function. Unfortunately it involves a significant overhead in initial total execution time (from create to an invoke result), so for many single-use lambdas this heavily reduces performance.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    participant LS as LocalStack Endpoint\r\n    participant RAPID as Runtime Init\r\n    participant RIC as Runtime Interface Client\r\n    LS-)RAPID: Start Container\r\n    RAPID-)RIC: Start RIC\r\n    alt Init success\r\n        RIC->>RAPID: next()\r\n        RAPID->>LS: Done\r\n    else\r\n        RIC->>RAPID: InitError\r\n        RAPID->>LS: DoneError\r\n    end\r\n    loop per invocation\r\n        LS-)RAPID: Invoke(id)\r\n\r\n        RAPID-->>+RIC: next: Invocation(id)\r\n        alt Invocation Success\r\n            RIC->>RAPID: InvocationResult(id)\r\n        else\r\n            RIC->>RAPID: InvocationError(id)\r\n        end\r\n        par Rapid to LocalStack\r\n            alt Invocation Success\r\n                RAPID->>LS: Response(id)\r\n            else\r\n                RAPID->>LS: ErrorResponse(id)\r\n            end\r\n        and RIC to Rapid\r\n            RIC->>-RAPID: next()\r\n        end\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nflowchart TD\r\n    API[Lambda API]\r\n    SERVICE[Lambda Service]\r\n    REPO[Repository]\r\n    VM[Version Manager]\r\n    ENV[Environment]\r\n    EXEC[Executor]\r\n    EXEC-CONN[Executor Connection]\r\n    subgraph CONTAINER\r\n        RAPID\r\n    end\r\n    API --> SERVICE\r\n    SERVICE --> REPO\r\n    SERVICE --> VM\r\n    VM --> ENV\r\n    ENV --> EXEC\r\n    EXEC <--> EXEC-CONN\r\n    EXEC-CONN -- invokes --> RAPID\r\n    RAPID -- result/status --> EXEC-CONN\r\n    EXEC -- starts/stops --> CONTAINER\r\n```",

In my docker container, I had both python3 as well as python2 installed. localstack was installed by using pip3. So all dependencies for localstack were installed for python3. \r\n\r\nHowever, the `python` command was pointing towards my python2 installation, and hence, the python process started by localstack failed to come up because it was unable to find any of the dependencies required and it failed silently.\r\n\r\nTo circumvent the issue, I just installed localstack within a venv and brought up S3 within that venv (after sourcing the venv) to make sure that running `python` points towards the correct version of `python` for which localstack dependencies were installed etc.\r\n\r\nTL;DR make sure that localstack and its dependencies are installed for the right python version and make sure that running `python` points towards the right python version as well.",

Start docker container with required dependencies (ensure HOSTNAME environment variable is set to something other than `localstack`, `localhost`, or unset. For example, `HOSTNAME = bc200a8f270b`).\r\n2. Run `localstack start`\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nUnset HOSTNAME environment variable while using localstack\r\n\r\nMy issue isn't actually with the S3 service, it's with dynamodb, but I'm having the same error as the S3 issue above, and I assume it's from the same issue as the same workarounds work.",

This PR updates both operations to properly respect the _dry_run_ flag, aligning their behavior with AWS expectations.\r\n\r\nSince IAM permission checks are not yet implemented in KMS, the primary purpose of this functionality is to determine whether a request would succeed (in which case a **DryRunOperationException** is raised when `dry_run=True`) or fail due to validation errors, rather than to enforce or simulate IAM permissions\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nYou can verify the behavior by executing the following CLI commands:\r\n```\r\nawslocal kms generate-data-key-pair \\\r\n  --key-id <key_id> \\\r\n  --key-pair-spec RSA_2048 \\\r\n  --dry-run\r\n\r\nawslocal kms generate-data-key-pair-without-plaintext \\\r\n  --key-id <key_id> \\\r\n  --key-pair-spec RSA_2048 \\\r\n  --dry-run\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the request is valid, these commands should return a **DryRunOperationException**. If the input is invalid, a validation error will be returned instead.\r\n\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at bringing a higher level of parity with apigateway headers. Some headers when not passed through appropriately will fail the invocation.\r\n\r\nAs noted on the [Important Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-known-issues.html) of the Api Gateway documention, some headers are either, dropped, passthrough or remapped from the users requests and following data transformations.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nA series of header manipulation in the handlers was added.\r\n#### Invocation\r\n(parsing handler)\r\n- Some headers are not making it into the context, for these we prevent populating them to the `InvocationRequest` when first parsing the incoming request (This change was introduces by #11227 )\r\n#### Request\r\n( integration request handler)\r\n- For HTTP_PPROXY integration, while most headers available to the context are passed through to the integration request, some seem to be removed BEFORE applying the mapping templates.\r\n- A set of headers will raise an `InternalServerError` if modified by request parameters of mapping templates. Even for `AWS_PROXY` where they are not applied, go figure :smile: \r\n- Some request headers are dropped after being applied.\r\n- Some request headers are default and we only apply them if not already set by the templates\r\n#### Response\r\n( method response handler)\r\n- Some headers are remapped with `x-amzn-Remapped-`\r\n- Some headers are dropped\r\n- Some headers are added as default if not set by the integration response. For example, `Connection`, seems to be taking from the original requests `Connection`\r\n \r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n",
