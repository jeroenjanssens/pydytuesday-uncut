They just want to download this amazing application and use it.\r\n\r\nThey might not understand why there's code, but would appreciate if a .EXE file was made and was simply handed to them. The dedicated maintainers might expect everyone to be developers that understands code. Well, some are not and they don't understand it. They only know to download and install applications. So what's the solution? Make an EXE file and give it to them. Again, thanks to the dedicated maintainers!",

This would also leave the structure open if other features were added in the future.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how the `data.json` file fits into this.  I am not sure how a packaged module understands the path to a random JSON file stored in the file system.  Perhaps we will put the data.json file into a completely different area.",

It was easier to just _rewrite_ it rather than adapt it for some reason.\r\n\r\n> Yes, poetry doesn't natively support dynamic versioning. We use community plugins for that. We don't need to rely on git tags; we can use the __version__ variable which should be located in sherlock/__init__.py (this is the location used by the community to store package metadata like version, name, etc.).\r\n> \r\n> The plugin we can use for this is: https://github.com/tiangolo/poetry-version-plugin\r\n\r\nMy original find was `poetry-dynamic-versioning`, but that dynamically populates version tags within the package rather than dynamically populating the pyproj from tags within the package (backwards). Your linked plugin might be better since it pulls from src as before\r\n\r\nOnly problem I've noticed is that there doesn't seem to be a way to *require* your plugin for builds. Since there is no backend, it also doesn't change how things are built sans-`poetry build`. python -m build will now forever use version 0, and poetry build itself will return 0 by default unless a dev goes out of their way to realize it's needed and install the plugin.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions to enforce this plugin, or just let people figure it out?",

Also, instead of merely using 'python3' I used 'python3.8' which is the latest version I have installed in addition to python2.7.  Hope that helps!!",

It may be that your PATH is not setup properly.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like some people have had issues with pip not being installed by default.  Look at this\r\n[Installing PIP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43304612/how-to-install-pip-on-python-3-6/47123768) entry on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nIf this is just a PATH issue, look in the \"Scripts\" directory where you have Python installed.  If you do see pip or pip3 installed in there, then you can pass the entire path to get to pip.  Because people often have multiple installs of Python on their machines, an individual distribution is not added to the PATH.",

Below are the details to help reproduce the bug:**\r\n\r\n**What I was trying to do:** I was running the Sherlock tool to collect information about specific usernames on various platforms.\r\n\r\n**What I expected to happen:** I expected the tool to download and access the data.json file successfully, allowing the program to run without any interruptions.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened:** Instead of successfully accessing the data.json file, I received an error message stating: \"Bad response while accessing data file URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/master/sherlock/resources/data.json.This suggests that the file may not be accessible or may have been moved or deleted.\r\n\r\n**Comment:** I checked the URL in my browser, and it seems to return an error, which indicates that the file may no longer be available. This issue could impact users trying to run the tool, as it relies on this data file. Please investigate the status of the data.json file and consider providing an alternative or a local copy option to ensure functionality.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n**Install Sherlock:**\r\nOpen your terminal or command prompt.\r\nRun the command: pip install sherlock.\r\n\r\n**Run Sherlock:**\r\nIn the terminal, execute the command: sherlock <username>, replacing <username> with any username you wish to search for.\r\n\r\n**Observe the Output:**\r\nMonitor the terminal output as the tool attempts to access the data.json file.\r\n\r\n**Error Encounter:**\r\nNote the error message that appears, specifically: \"Bad response while accessing data file URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/master/sherlock/resources/data.json.\r\n\r\n**Check URL Manually:**\r\nOpen a web browser and navigate to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/master/sherlock/resources/data.json.\r\n**Confirm if the file is accessible or if an error (e.g., 404 Not Found) is displayed.**\n\n### Additional information\n\n### Bug Reported by: Shiva Ganesh Talikota\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

The latest versions of Sherlock no longer supports Python 3.7, so Pip automatically selects the latest compatible version, which unfortunately uses a broken GitHub URL for the `data.json` file.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, try upgrading your Python version by running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install python3\r\n```\r\n\r\n(or an alternative depending on your distribution). After upgrading, reinstall the package and it should work",

          "body": "> 404: Not Found\r\n\r\nLooks like you're running an old version of Sherlock (latest is `v0.15.0`). The URL you mentioned (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/master/sherlock/resources/data.json`) isn\u2019t valid in newer Sherlock versions. They've updated the file structure, causing older versions to throw errors. The new URL for `data.json` is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/master/sherlock_project/resources/data.json`.\r\n\r\nHere's what you can do: Run `pipx install sherlock-project --force` (or use another method based on how you installed Sherlock\u2014[`pipx` is recommended](https://sherlockproject.xyz/installation)) to ensure you have the latest version of Sherlock. Check it with `sherlock --version`. If it\u2019s still on `v0.14.1` or similar, your Python might be outdated, check it using `python3 --version` or `python --version`, if it doesn't show `Python 3.9` or upwards, update your Python by following these steps:\r\n\r\n- **Windows 10/11**:\r\n  - Get the installer from [Python's site](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).\r\n  - Run it and proceed as directed.\r\n  - Check your version with `python3 --version` (or `python.exe --version`)\u2014should be 3.9+.\r\n  - If not, restart and try again.\r\n- **Linux**:\r\n  - **Debian/Kali/Ubuntu**:  \r\n    - Run `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade python3`.\r\n  - **Arch/EndeavourOS/Manjaro**:\r\n    - Run `pacman -Syy` and `pacman -S python3`.\r\n  - **Fedora**:\r\n    - Run `sudo dnf check-update` and `sudo dnf upgrade python3`.\r\n  - Confirm with `python --version` that it shows 3.9+.\r\n\r\nOnce updated, try installing Sherlock again. You might also find [this page helpful](https://sherlockproject.xyz/installation).\r\n\r\nIf you're **sure** you have the latest Sherlock version, check if `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` is blocked in your network. Test with:\r\n```\r\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/master/sherlock_project/resources/data.json\r\n```\r\n(or `curl.exe` on Windows) and see if you get a response [like this one](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ab6d160-81be-4205-93be-7a0363853496).\r\n\r\nIf **none** of the methods above work, try using Sherlock with the `--local` option like this:\r\n```\r\nsherlock --local username_goes_here\r\n```\r\nAs I've mentioned before, this workaround isn't ideal. The local `data.json` on your system updates only when the Sherlock package itself is updated, which, frankly, doesn't happen often. That's why pulling the remote file from GitHub is recommended and the default behavior of Sherlock.\r\n\r\n/thread",

Publishing it only on PyPI seems to be the best path.\r\n\r\nThis would also be easier to maintain, due to having a single point of origin.\r\n\r\nSherlock doesn't seem like the type of project that needs specific packaging for each platform at the moment. With the exception of installation on Termux environments, which apparently has some issues installing pandas; I talk more about this here: https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1945#issuecomment-1850757406\r\n\r\n@sdushantha @ppfeister What do you think of these thoughts?",

          "body": "Pretty good question\r\n\r\nI think we all agree on PyPI, so I'll skip that one\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to DockerHub, currently, users who want docker one offs for some sort of workflow are required to pull and regularly maintain the source. Having the image available on DockerHub and/or ghcr is a pretty huge boon for people who containerize (including myself).\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to maintenance... we already have a Dockerfile, and that's all that was really needed. Whenever there's an update, it's just a quick `docker build && docker push`, which can be workflow-ed as well.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSo, is packaging _elsewhere_ required? Absolutely not. It's more of an nicety than anything else. For myself, I tend to prefer native binaries when able, but again, that's only a _preference_. When I can find a package via dnf/apt/yum/etc, I'm somewhat more likely to use that specific package than if I had to use some other package manager. As a user, being able to run a quick `${pkg manager} update` is much more pleasant than `apt update && flatpak update && pip update && snap update && ...` since everything wants to be on a different package manager nowadays.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to upkeep, it's not zero, but it's really not _that much_. When a new version is ready, I just bump the version number in the spec and press build. The actual upkeep is pretty minimal, and the only thing that's likely to break that process is if there was a massive overhaul of Sherlock that added a few dozen niche and not-yet-present-on-distro dependencies.",

Poetry would probably simplify packaging all around (pypi included) if it works as I've heard.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n@p-linnane Great timing\r\n\r\nThat's often how it goes. I'm not sure of many projects of this size that have full coverage without community support.\r\n\r\nMain reason I'm taking care of Fedora + EPEL is because I'm a Fedora and rhel user myself. I wouldn't dare try to maintain a homebrew package, or an official Arch one, for instance.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, what's your targeted pkg name? Seems there's a sherlock already on homebrew.\r\n\r\nFor the rpm, the package name is expected to be sherlock-project, due to required parity with PyPI (where a `sherlock` also already existed).

I think community involvement with this is the best way forward.\r\n\r\n> I would like to resume the convo about switching from setuptools to poetry, when able. I'm not sure why poetry didn't seem to work but I feel like I must have been doing something wrong with it. Poetry would probably simplify packaging all around (pypi included) if it works as I've heard.\r\n\r\n@ppfeister, sorry for the delay in reviewing your PR, I've been a bit busy lately. I think I'll be able to review it more carefully later today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The first method will receive updates faster, but the second method will update automatically when you update Kali. Not a big enough difference to matter to most people.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to clone the repo for either --- just run that and you're done",

Make sure to select the Python dialect before doing your experiments.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a Facebook user name must be 5 to 50 characters.  I am not clear if it is allowed to start with a number or not (so I assumed that it was ok).  And, I specifically do not allow .com, .org, and .net as a suffix.  So, that gives me the following regular expression.\r\n\r\n```^[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9\\.]|-(?=[a-zA-Z0-9\\.])){4,49}(?<!.com|.org|.net)$```\r\n\r\nI would check it out a bit before committing it.

Particularly, this quote by @hoadlck is relevant:\r\n\r\n> There are approximately 5 bazillion Internet Forums out there, and if all of them were added to Sherlock then it is really going to add much churn. It would be like trying to release a Python module that had a snapshot of a **search engine index** embedded inside of it. It just would not scale.\r\n\r\nWould adding options to find users by profile information or email transform Sherlock into a search engine. If so, is that something we want to do?\r\n\r\nI have not invested enough time into this issue to have an opinion on this solution, I just wanted to bring up this similar discussion. It's up to @TheYahya, @hoadlck, and you guys to decide on the scope!",

It's not a requirement as per the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, nowhere it's mentioned that the contributor is supposed to run the script before opening a PR. My previous PRs were also accepted without such a requirement. So I'm not obliged to do something that isn't required and is an optional step (Which is also not being suggested by the author anyway). I read the contributing guidelines before creating any PRs. \r\n\r\nSo I suggest you to rather work on improving the contributing guidelines as well as the script which is buggy at the moment as we know than telling me what to do.

But, it also was not formalized by adding it to the contribution guide (it was just discussed when the site updater was added).  Considering how flaky the Alexa API is, it is probably best that the individual users do not run the site update, as it always zeros out the rankings when if flakes out.  Thinking on this some more, it would probably be better to have the person doing the merge verify the tests and run the site updater: the history on the data.json file gets scrambled each time that site update is run, as the ranking gets messed with.\r\n\r\nThis project is new yet, and there are plenty of rough edges.  There are many areas where we could make the contribution process more clear.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I am more concerned with a contributor running the tests.  Quite a few of the PRs do not have valid user names: they are just copies of whatever site the last entry was patterned after.  Even when it is obvious that the author did not follow the guidelines, I will often fix things up before doing the merge.",

I hope this script will speed up the process of adding sites both for unexperienced and experienced users. I made it as much user friendly and fail proof as possible, but I still want to work on it, so the user doesn't even have to copy the code.\r\nAs a proof of concept, I've also added two sites generated with my script and just simply pasted into the data.json.",

The class committed only contain error, log and info methods for printing to the stdout using the color package.\r\n\r\n## SherlockService class:\r\nA unique SherlockService which performs asynchronous requests to HTTP and HTTPS web server using requests and grequests. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you :+1: ",

          "body": "As requested, I'll give a brief overview of what I think the problem is and how you can fix it. Feel free to ask questions, especially if you don't fully understand any of the terminology (branch vs fork, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Background Info\r\n\r\nA fork is essentially a copy of this main repo that you have full control over. When you make changes to the code, you don't actually have permission to push that code to branches on @TheYahya's repo. Instead, you made a [copy of the entire repo](https://github.com/theodosisathanasakis/sherlock) and push your changes to that copy. When you submit a PR on GitHub, you are essentially \"requesting\" @TheYahya to \"pull\" the changes from a specific branch in your repo into `master` branch on his repo (hence the name \"pull request\"). You can see this in the PR heading:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11142171/50664940-de36b780-0f7c-11e9-9409-d2232bed1b2b.png)\r\n\r\nNotice the blue fields specify `<repo-name> : <branch-name>`\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nLooking at [your fork](https://github.com/theodosisathanasakis/sherlock), the problem is that you worked on PR #64 directly on your fork's `master` branch. We can see your [commit for PR #64](https://github.com/theodosisathanasakis/sherlock/commits/master) directly on `theodosisathanasakis:master`. Instead, you should always keep your fork's `master` branch up to date with the main repo's `master` branch, and make each PR in a separate branch on your fork. \r\n\r\nYou did that for this PR (you used branch `theodosisathanasakis-script`), which is good! However, because your previous PR made changes directly in master, `theodosisathanasakis-script` also received these changes. We can see the commit (from PR #64) above.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11142171/50665120-83519000-0f7d-11e9-87d6-8c8c878855bd.png)\r\n\r\n## Fixing the Issue\r\n\r\nBecause PR #64 is still open and is based directly of your fork's `master` branch, we **DO NOT** want to modify anything on the `master` branch just yet. If we do, then we would mess up that PR.\r\n\r\nSo we'll have to workaround this. Essentially what we want to do is \"delete\" the 2nd to last commit (the \"regexCheck\" commit) but \"keep\" the last commit (the \"linux script\") on this branch. To do so, we will actually \"delete\" both commits and \"re-copy\" the last commit manually. More specifically, we will:\r\n\r\n- Copy the commit id of the \"linux script\" commit, which is `f84629cc460f1501f49dceef6fbffbc40106981c`. You can find this id by doing `git log` or by looking at [your commits in your \"script\" branch](https://github.com/theodosisathanasakis/sherlock/commits/theodosisathanasakis-script).\r\n- Delete the last 2 commits from the branch. Note that this doesn't actually delete your work from git. The commits will still exist in git, just not in the branch.\r\n- Cherry-pick the \"linux script\" commit onto the branch (using the commit id above). This will essentially copy that last commit onto your branch without copying the \"regexCheck\" commit.\r\n- Double check the work, and then **force push** to your fork. GitHub will automatically pick up on the changes and modify this PR to match your branch.\r\n\r\nHere's the commands to do so. **Please make sure** you're on the `theodosisathanasakis-script` branch and you have no changes to commit when you do this!\r\n\r\n1. Delete 2 commits from branch: `git reset HEAD~2`\r\n2. Cherry-pick only last commit onto branch: `git cherry-pick f84629cc460f1501f49dceef6fbffbc40106981c`\r\n3. Ensure files look correct and your script exists. Do a `git log` and make sure it has your \"script\" commit but not the \"regexCheck\" commit.\r\n4. Force push to your fork: `git push --force`\r\n\r\nDon't worry if you mess up! I made a copy of your work and can restore it if you accidentally delete it ;)",

      "body": "Dear Sherlock maintainers,\r\n\r\nI have wrapped Sherlock as an Apify Actor by adding the [Actor definition](https://whitepaper.actor/#actor-definition-files?fpr=sherlock) in the `.actor` directory and published the [Sherlock Actor on Apify Store](https://apify.com/netmilk/sherlock?fpr=sherlock) a while ago. I've also added the [Actor status badge](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/status-badge?fpr=sherlock) and a brief usage description to the README, including the \u201cRun on Apify\u201d button that can drive further adoption.\r\n\r\n**The Sherlock actor is used by ~200 unique users per month, with a total of around 800 users.** For the full description of the Actor, please see the [README](https://github.com/netmilk/sherlock/blob/main/.actor/README.md) file in the `.actor` directory.\r\n\r\nSherlock can now be used in the cloud without installation, free of charge. Even less technical users can avoid managing Python environment locally. The Actor can be used either from [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/actors/fe64zPaNdcva7wzOF/source?fpr=sherlock), [API](https://apify.com/netmilk/sherlock/api?fpr=sherlock), or [CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli/?fpr=sherlock) locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\napify call netmilk/sherlock -i '{\r\n  \"usernames\": [\"johndoe\", \"janedoe\"]\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease see another open-source [Actor example in the Docling project](https://github.com/docling-project/docling/tree/main/.actor) for further inspiration.\r\n\r\n## Apify will sponsor your project\r\n\r\nAll the links to Apify in this PR are affiliate links under the [Apify open source fair share program](https://apify.com/partners/open-source-fair-share?fpr=sherlock) with id `sherlock` in the **passive tier** of the program. In the passive tier, Apify commits to sending a monthly commission via the GitHub Sponsor button from all new sign-ups that come through your link. In your case distributed evenly to @sdushantha, @ppfeister, and @matheusfelipeog. The only action required on your part is to accept this pull request.\r\n\r\nYou can earn a larger commission and gain insights into traffic by registering directly with Apify, claiming ownership of the Actor on the Apify Store, and maintaining the Actor yourself. Simply [contact support](mailto:open-source@apify.com) after signing up and pass the ownership challenge. The Actor will then be transferred, e.g., to `sherlock-project/sherlock`, and you\u2019ll see it under your Apify account.\r\n\r\nTo further increase your income from Apify, you can convert your Actor on [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store?fpr=sherlock) to the [pay-per-event pricing model](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/actors-in-store#pay-per-event?fpr=sherlock) and join the _active developer tier_. We offer an individual competitive advantage for the active developer tier in the form of either a significantly reduced Apify margin or discounted compute unit pricing. Feel free to ask for it!\r\n\r\n## Benefits of the Actor Programming Model\r\n[The Web Actor Programming Model](https://whitepaper.actor/?fpr=sherlock) is a new concept for building serverless microapps, which are easy to develop, share, integrate, and build upon. Actors are a reincarnation of the UNIX philosophy for programs running in the cloud. Actors are web automation tools that are easy to integrate and scale up. The main benefit is that even a small piece of software can be turned into a public cloud service in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\n[Apify](https://apify.com/?fpr=sherlock) is the largest ecosystem where developers build, deploy, and publish data extraction, web automation tools, and AI agents. With over 4,000 Actors on Apify Store and 10 years of experience in the market, Apify makes Sherlock accessible to over 250,000 developers using the platform monthly. This also enables integration with other Actors on Store, custom Actors, and [platform integrations](https://apify.com/integrations?fpr=sherlock) that can create much more powerful workflows than just individual parts.\r\n\r\n## Full disclosure\r\nI work at Apify. Apify doesn\u2019t sell your software, but we sell the computing resources needed to run your software in the cloud to the end users. Your project is one of the first we selected to pilot [Apify's open source fair share program](https://apify.com/partners/open-source-fair-share?fpr=sherlock). Please let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help you accept this PR! **If you do, we\u2019d be pleased to feature your project in our marketing communication.**\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me [@netmilk](https://github.com/netmilk), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkliment), or just write us to [open-source@apify.com](mailto:open-source@apify.com). We're always excited to work with the open source community! There's definitely room for improvement regarding performance, error handling, coverage of the Sherlock CLI parameters and release management, Apify proxies usage. ",

          "body": "Hi, @netmilk. Thank you very much for opening this PR, providing detailed explanations, and for your interest in supporting the project. We truly appreciate it \u2764\ufe0f \r\n\r\nI just read more about Apify and the [Actors whitepaper](https://whitepaper.actor/), and it looks great, well structured and solid. Congratulations on the project, and I hope it continues to grow.\r\n\r\nI find the possibility of using the Sherlock project in the cloud in a simplified way particularly interesting. It could expand the user base for those who don\u2019t want to deal with the technical aspects of a local execution and reduce the number of related issues, even though it has already become easier nowadays.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure if I missed something, but the sponsorship and user access part wasn\u2019t entirely clear to me. Would it be based on user sign-ups on the Apify platform, for example, using the free tier (with $5 per month for free) to run the Sherlock Actor? Would that be the expected flow?\r\n\r\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if having a dedicated section for Apify in the `README.md` would be the best approach. Maybe just having a one-click button in the header, [similar to what the Docling project has](https://github.com/docling-project/docling?tab=readme-ov-file#docling)? And for more details, perhaps a section in the documentation named \"Using in the Cloud\", with Apify as an option? [Similar to Docling\u2019s documentation](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/integrations/apify/). This could also be a place to list other platforms where Sherlock could be integrated and used.\r\n\r\n@sdushantha @ppfeister What do you think? What are your thoughts on this?",

          "body": "Hey @matheusfelipeog, it means the world to me that you like the idea. Thank you for letting us know and for giving the whitepaper a read! I'm excited. \r\n\r\nThe passive tier of the fair share works similarly to general affiliate programs:\r\n- The unique `sherlock` link will set cookies when users visit Apify from the Sherlock project. \r\n- If they sign up, you\u2019ll receive $0.10 for every $1 they spend during their first three months on Apify, and $0.20 after that. \r\n- This does not include spending from the freemium $5 you mentioned as that is purely our cost. The commission is on the spending your project brings to Apify. ~~This includes spending from the freemium $5 you mentioned (with anti-fraud measures in place).~~\r\n- We'll send the commission through the GitHub Sponsors program each month. No action is required on your part other than accepting this PR. \r\n- If you sign up for Apify, claim the Actor on Apify, maintain it yourself, and provide your business details, you'll receive a 10% higher commission via the payment method of your choice against an invoice.\r\n- The referral works even outside of GitHub (e.g., YouTube, LinkedIn).\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m happy to revise the PR based on your preferences, I believe it's in your best interest to keep Apify prominently featured in the README. I\u2019d suggest keeping the \u201cRun on Apify\u201d button and/or the copy-paste friendly code snippet, as they are self-explanatory and can drive the Developer Experience of your project. I'd suggest reviewing it after a few months when you (we) see how it performs and after we try to market it.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this explanation helps clarify how the Apify open source fair share program works. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you need any additional information or assistance from me. I'm looking forward to it! \r\n\r\nEDIT: I corrected my mistake about the commission on freemium.\r\n",

Thank you for giving it a try.\r\n\r\n> If one of us claim the actor and maintain it ourselves (with the extra 10%), would payment be directed to the account holder only, or could that person opt for it to still be dispersed via GitHub Sponsors?\r\n\r\nThe _maintainer tier of the Apify open source fair share program_ is designed for payouts via standard payment methods (SEPA/SWIFT/PayPal), one payment per month, to minimize our overhead in favor of the larger commission. But, let me know what's your preference and we'll do our best to be as flexible as possible.\r\n\r\nOne more option to further monetize the Actor is to implement the [Apify Pay per Event model](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize?fpr=sherlock#pay-per-event-pricing-model) and set the pricing yourself. You won't then earn the commission on that specific PPE actor anymore, but you'll still keep the commission on all the spending on other Actors that you bring to Apify via your `sherlock` fair share link. Maintainer and Active developer tiers aren't mutually exclusive. Think of it as in \"Sherlock Lite\" \u2013 this free, pay per usage trial, and \"Sherlock Pro\" \u2013 the super optimized, performance PPE versions of the Actor in the Apify Store. \r\n\r\nI don't want to overcomplicate things, though. So, if the entire proposition in this PR sounds acceptable to you, I'd kindly ask you if we could go ahead and merge the PR in the _passive tier_ soon and refactor it afterward. I'd just like to prevent the snowballing of the scope. I promise our instant assistance in case of future development \u2013 just mention me or @souravjain540 in any future PRs or send an email to open-source@apify.com.",

          "body": "Hey folks, sorry for the delay in my reply.\r\n\r\n> ... @matheusfelipeog, any final thoughts before they deploy (with our merge for .actor/)?\r\n\r\nYes. Actually, it's the same point I initially raised about the highlight in the README, but maybe I didn\u2019t express it clearly enough:\r\n\r\n> ... Also, I\u2019m not sure if having a dedicated section for Apify in the README.md would be the best approach. Maybe just having a one-click button in the header, [similar to what the Docling project has](https://github.com/docling-project/docling?tab=readme-ov-file#docling)? And for more details, perhaps a section in the documentation named \"Using in the Cloud\", with Apify as an option? [Similar to Docling\u2019s documentation](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/integrations/apify/). This could also be a place to list other platforms where Sherlock could be integrated and used.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand it\u2019s in our interest, as well put by @netmilk, I still hold to my initial thought for the following reason:\r\n\r\nHaving a specific section with multiple links to Apify gives me the impression of exclusivity, which I believe should be reserved for direct sponsorships given the monthly visibility the Sherlock project receives - not for indirect ones like an affiliate program. From my experience with this in other projects, this is generally how it\u2019s handled in the OSS community.\r\n\r\nThis idea is reinforced by the suggestion I made to have a section in the documentation such as \"Using in the Cloud,\" where we could list all the easy-to-use options currently available or that might become available in the future for running Sherlock. Running the project on Apify\u2019s infrastructure would be listed in that section, alongside others, simply as one option - without giving the impression of exclusivity in a high-visibility area of the project.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I don\u2019t have any further comments. Everything looks good to me, and I\u2019m glad our team also liked it. \ud83e\udd1d \r\n\r\n@sdushantha @ppfeister What do you think about this line of thought?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> One more, slightly controversial thing. I've come across this [super rude Reddit post mentioning the Sherlock project](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1at9br4/i_am_new_to_github_and_i_have_lots_to_say/). ...\r\n\r\nJust a quick note on that. I have to admit it was fun to follow along when that meme took over the tech bubble. In case anyone\u2019s interested, there was a long discussion with some \"serious\" comments here https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/2006 and my official comment here https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/2006#issuecomment-1981592479",

This would reduce the number of flags needed without losing any functionality, simplifying sherlock.\r\n\r\nAlso, when packaged, I don't see this inclusion being very valuable in such an odd spot. In my mind, it would make more sense to drop data.json when packaged, and have the default location for --json become (only when packaged) `~/.config/sherlock/data.json` for in the event a user specified one is present.",

I for some reason through that `--local` was able to take a path to a `.json` file, but that is not the case. So i agree with your suggestion on scrapping `--local` and using `--json` instead. What are your thoughts on this @matheusfelipeog?",

I installed Git and ran the commands through there, but I did get an error message. I did the command: \r\n\"$ git clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git\"\r\n- And had it downloaded. Then I cd'd into sherlock: \"cd sherlock\"\r\n- Lastly I ran \"pip3 install -r requirements.txt\" and downloaded everything. I did though get something near the end that read:\r\n\r\n\"You should consider upgrading via the 'C:\\Users\\19706\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.\"\r\n\r\nDon't know if I should get it, but nonetheless, I digress.

I don't think that we can add a command line option for every grouping of website:  the command line list would explode.\r\n\r\nImplementing tags would provide just one command line option to filter the search.  For example, if the user wanted to search for a certain name on video sites, then the command would be as follows:\r\n```\r\n% python3 sherlock --tag video user123\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as adult sites in Sherlock, I did not think we were going to do that.  Or at least, not as a default.  Any user can use the `--json` option to pass a JSON file with adult sites in it.  If they do that, then no special option or tag is required:  the site list would already have nothing but adult sites.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be a good idea to make the `--json` option additive: when the user has one of these options, it adds to the list of sites (instead of replacing them).  This would allow people to use the option multiple times to build up a super-list of sites.",

I have a PHP implementation (not yet open-sourced) that's working extremely fast and is based on Sherlock's data file but that file itself needs some changes (like in a few cases we need to send some mandatory custom HTTP headers and thus, the data file needs them added too where required).\r\n\r\nAlso, I think any other implementations should rely on the upstream's data file than a forked version because then we'd have to continue to maintain multiple copies and keep them in sync (even if it's based off a similar format). It's already in a good format (JSON) and with minor tweaks, it'll get better. Could also add an automated script to map the entire data into different file formats (should that be required for whatever reasons -- CSV file?). \r\n\r\n",

Doesn't really sound good TBH.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion, obviously you're free to do what you like as the owner/maintainer but sharing what I felt.",

I realize that some of the extensions/integrations available on GitHub means that the readme has turned into a billboard for the project.  But, it makes looking at the readme in text a pain: the beginning looks like a raw HTML page.\r\n\r\nBut, that is just my opinion.  We can get @sdushantha and @TheYahya to weigh in on adding a new section to the readme.\r\n\r\nAs far as adding any specific implementation to the readme...I would say that it should meet some basic bar of functionality.  For example, having some basic tests.  Even with tests, Sherlock still has major problems with false positives, so any serious implementation needs to deal with that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way...  Since this topic does seem to be more about advertising/discovery, I did run [mesuutt/sherlock](https://github.com/mesuutt/sherlock).  Comparing the run times for the compiled Go application with running Python Sherlock in interpreted mode (with the Python code having more sites), I am seeing Python winning.  For example, 27.078s (Sherlock Python) versus 29.791s (Go) when searching for the common \"blue\" username).  I would expect that any implementation would have similar performance: the bottleneck is in the sites that the tool is probing and the internet connection, not with the CPU cycles on the box running the test.",

I added `print(data)` right after the `data = net_info.get('request_payload', None)` line. I did this so that I could see what the value of `data` was and this is what the output:\r\n```\r\n{\"username\": \"{}\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see, the username is actually not being used in this POST data.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> The new property works on all request method.\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing this property also works on GET requests? I'd rather have this property only be used for POST requests because in a GET request, you usually put the data along with with the request url.\r\nInstead of calling the property `request_payload`, it would be better to call it `post_data` so that it is clear to others that this property is only to be used for POST requests.",

So, I have added those error messages in the data.json file.\r\nNow the core module sherlock.py only supports one error message in form of string. So I have modified that file and handled the case so that it can support a list/array of messages.\r\nAs a result, Tinder which was reporting False-Positives is handled, and now it returns correct results.\r\nAlso, this can be helpful in the future, in order to support multiple error messages for different sites.",

You are correct, there is a very high chance that we might be bombarded with issues regarding the error thrown by Sherlock.\r\n\r\nI do have a small idea to propose regarding this issue. We could have a file for notices or messages which we want the users to see. Sherlock would check this file on GitHub every time it ran and if there was a message, it would output that to the user. We could also have a \"command word\" such as `<<kill>>`, that would allow us to forcefully stop Sherlock and then have a message for them telling to go and get the latest version because the current version will not work with the updated `data.json`",

I pushed this fix to the master branch.\r\n\r\nBut, I am seeing a similar error when running the command in a Git Bash shell.  In this case, the error happens without the ```--csv``` option...it occurs when reporting the results of the query. Bafflingly enough, everything is fine if I run the command in a Git Command shell.\r\n\r\nWhat is the story with \"Raj\u010de.net\"?  If I enter that actual domain name, it goes to some weird place. It might be a parking page.  The actual URL is \"https://www.rajce.idnes.cz/\"?  I think that it is the [caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron) that is causing the grief.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if I could drop the caron and avoid the whole issue.\r\n\r\nP.S.  Google translate is saying that \"Raj\u010de\" means \"Tomato\"?  So, this is a tomato photo sharing site? :)\r\n",

Which, even if it works today, could very well break tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that there would be a `tests` directory that would contain Python code that would run various tests.  The main input to these tests would be a curated list of user names that are supported at a given social media site, and another list of user names that are not.  \r\n\r\n- For Each Social Media Site A List Of User Names Supported\r\nCurated list of user names known to be supported.\r\n- For Each Social Media Site A List Of User Names Not Supported\r\nCurated list of user names known to **not** be supported.\r\n- Python Module That Runs Through List And Compares Results To Expected\r\nThis would be the code that would run after changes have been made to the module.

If the option is not on the command line, the the entire list would be ran.\r\n\r\nWith this option, the test could just be a Python script that called the Sherlock main() routine over and over with different user names and subset of sites.  When a user added a new site, they would also be required to add at least one user that existed and did not exist to the test suite.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

This would also leave the structure open if other features were added in the future.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how the `data.json` file fits into this.  If Sherlock is going to turn into a web application (or have an implementation that runs that way), then storing the information in a database is the way to go.  Maybe there is another directory with the data in it.  When Sherlock starts up (if it is running as a command line tool), it could fetch the latest JSON file from the web.  If it has any problem, it would default to using the last file that it was able to grab (or, in the worst case, the file that shipped with the install).",

This allows for all requests to make progress at the same time, resulting in a ~2x performance increase.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\n*Updated on 12/30/18, as stated in [this comment](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/pull/3#issuecomment-450540287)*\r\n\r\n**Currently:** 1.94s user, 1.50s system, 50% cpu, **40.5665 seconds**\r\n\r\n**With this PR:** 1.89s user 1.75s system 95% cpu **3.50564 seconds**\r\n\r\nThis is a massive improvement (as expected)!\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- For this type of I/O task, asynchronous programming would have been much better solution than concurrent programming. However, python does not have great support for asynchronous programs. Some asynchronous libraries I tried using required `Microsoft Build Tools` as a dependency on windows, so I decided to keep the project \"simple to install\" and did not rely on such libraries. If anyone knows of a simple asynchronous programming library in python (that does not require native dependencies), please let me know!\r\n- Sometimes HTTP requests fail and throw an exception in the program. This is not an issue with my changes in this PR, and this issue can be fixed my merging PR #1 ",

Glad to explain my thoughts and process.\r\n\r\nSo you are correct that running `dict.get(\"key\")` will return `None` if the key is not in the dictionary. However, in your case above, chaining the get calls will actually still throw an exception if the first key doesn't exist! `data.get(\"blabla\").get(\"bloblo\")` becomes `None.get(\"bloblo\")`, which will throw an exception because `None` does not have a `get` method. This will return None only if the second key (`\"bloblo\"`) doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nMy code (using `[]` instead of `get`) doesn't fix this issue either and would throw exceptions for both keys. *However, I argue that throwing an exception is actually better than letting the program continue on.* Of course, this is debatable, but I'll give you my intuition with an example:\r\n\r\nLet's look at [this line of code](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/blob/cb62daa5575b7af33aa25e9c3a925f9a78e703e8/sherlock.py#L69) and assume for some reason it returns `None`, as you would like above. What would happen? Well, then `error_type=None` and none of the [4 major if statements](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/blob/cb62daa5575b7af33aa25e9c3a925f9a78e703e8/sherlock.py#L78) are executed. This means that nothing would be printed for the social network site, giving the user an incorrect result if the username actually did exist on that site.\r\n\r\nWhy is this bad? *When we fail to load the correct data from the dictionary, we should not continue on with the program and pretend like nothing happened because that will result in incorrect results for the user!* There is no way we can fix/recover from this at run-time, and we certainly shouldn't ignore it. Instead, we should notify the user that something bad happened (via an exception). So in a case like this, throwing an exception and ending the program early is actually better than giving incorrect results. \r\n\r\nLet me know if that makes sense. Obviously, I'd be happy to change it back to `[]` instead of `get` if you still want me to. I just wrote up this long explanation to give you some intuition behind the scenes, hopefully it was helpful :)",

I dont want merge some code which I dont know how it works.\r\n> All I know is that the program runs faster \ud83d\ude04\r\n\r\nOf course, glad you're curious!\r\n\r\n## Identifying the Bottleneck\r\n\r\nLet's identify the **bottleneck** in your code first. At a conceptual level, your code needs to make 75 requests to various websites. The way your code currently does that is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor every URL:\r\n    send the request\r\n    --wait for the website to respond--\r\n    extract the response, then print out the result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **bottleneck** is the `wait for the website to respond`, which is [this line of code](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/blob/cb62daa5575b7af33aa25e9c3a925f9a78e703e8/sherlock.py#L76). Note that you didn't code this line out explicitly, but that is how the `requests` python library works internally. This is known as a **blocking call**.\r\n\r\nHow long are we wasting waiting for the website to respond? Well, we can assume that we wait around `100ms` based on my experiences and [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/628229/what-is-considered-average-request-processing-time). This includes time for our request to actually get to the web server, for the web server to process it, and for it to send back a HTML response. So that means in total, we are waiting 75 URLs * 100ms per URL = 7000 ms = **7 seconds**. We waste around 7 seconds waiting for responses to arrive back! So the blocking requests are our **bottleneck**.\r\n\r\n## Why Multi-threading?\r\n\r\nNow let's get to the actual multi-threading part. I'll give some quick background info on CPUs and threads. Most computers have multiple **cores**, usually 2 or 4. At any given time, each core can run a single **thread**. So if you have 4 **cores**, your computer can run 4 **threads** at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe current code on master is single-threaded, like most python code. That means that all your code only runs in a single CPU. At any given time, that CPU can only do a small amount of work, so it will take long (around 7 seconds) for it to run your entire program.\r\n\r\nSo I used multi-threading and modified the program to run on multiple CPUs! Instead of taking a long time to run on a single CPU, I had it run faster by using multiple CPUs. This is a concept called **parallelism**.\r\n\r\n## Understanding the Performance Gains\r\n\r\nFor now, let's pretend your computer has 4 cores, meaning it can run 4 threads at the same time. \r\n\r\nWe need to **parallelize** the blocking requests. Instead of sending out 1 request and waiting for a response on a *single* CPU, we can send out 1 request on *each* CPU. That means at any given time, we are actually waiting for 4 responses instead of just 1! If we have each of the 4 CPUs send out 75/4 requests, then each CPU will only send out ~19 requests. While we still have to wait for responses, we are only waiting 19 URLs * 100 ms per URL = 1900 ms = **1.9 seconds** because 4 requests happen in **parallel**.\r\n\r\n## Maximizing Performance\r\n\r\nThis last part is a little more complicated and harder to explain. Notice that [in this line](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/blob/c4c31530fff45073b31db6aa3eab34e44e92061a/sherlock.py#L10), I set the `max_workers` (threads) for the `session` equal to the number of social network sites (assume 75 like above). How can we create 75 threads if we only have 4 CPUs? Well, CPUs will perform **context switching** and run each thread of a very short amount of time, move onto the next one, repeat, and then loop back to the beginning thread. [This SO post explains it better](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3126400/4402434).\r\n\r\nAnyways, we [create all the requests here](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/blob/c4c31530fff45073b31db6aa3eab34e44e92061a/sherlock.py#L57). Each request runs in it's own thread. We then iterate back through them and get back the response [in this line of code](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/blob/c4c31530fff45073b31db6aa3eab34e44e92061a/sherlock.py#L70). Note that `result()` is **blocking**. It will pause the program until a response occurs. But while the program is paused on the first URL, all 74 other URLs are still running because they are running on different threads!\r\n\r\nThis results in amazing performance, because all 75 requests run at the same time. Using the numbers from before, this means we only have to wait 100ms for all the responses to come back!\r\n\r\nOf course, this number isn't realistic because having 75 threads has overhead. The CPU takes time to context switch. Plus, some websites may be slower than others. If one website takes 750ms to respond, our program still has to wait for this to finish, even if the other 74 requests finished in 150ms. This is known as [tail latency](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/12/google-taming-the-long-latency-tail-when-more-machines-equal.html), which is a whole different (and complicated) topic! However, I have tested it and it has consistently beaten out using `1` or `4` threads.\r\n\r\nHope that helps! Was fun to write this out :)",

Please see the two comments below, I'll let you decide when the best time to merge would be.\r\n\r\n@mpieters93 I had to make modifications to your TOR code (in PR #31). If I did it correctly, it should run all the TOR requests using the `ThreadPoolExecutor`, meaning they can run in parallel on separate threads. Unfortunately, I am having difficulty installing TOR on my Windows PC to actually test it... If you get a chance, could you (or anyone with TOR working) test this functionality? Thanks!!\r\n\r\n@Alchez If you get a chance, could you (or anyone else) send in a separate PR for [your comment](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/pull/3#issuecomment-450090152)? The diff for this PR is already very large, so I think splitting it into a different PR would be the best idea. I have reverted back to using `.get()` instead of `[]` on my dictionaries (as @sdushantha requested), so this should be easy to implement.",

Not sure why [my initial benchmark](https://github.com/sdushantha/sherlock/pull/3#issue-240891271) showed a very low synchronous time (6.818s), this is more in line with what I was expecting.

I think I wasn't very clear about the idea; I'll improve it:\r\n\r\n1. In the next version, whether it is major, minor, or patch, we would add a small notification to be shown in the terminal whenever the user runs the command with the --tor or --unique_tor flag.\r\n2. This message will inform the user that the feature will be discontinued in the future and that we recommend using the --proxy flag for this case.\r\n3. In a future major update, we would remove all code related to these tor features.\r\n\r\nWe already do something similar to inform that there is a new update of Sherlock, for example.\r\n\r\nThis makes the transition smooth and doesn't surprise the users. And realistically, very few people read the release notes.",

We can set it as optional in the `pyproject.toml`:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\r\ntorrequest = { version = \"^0.1.0\", optional = true }\r\n\r\n[tool.poetry.extras]\r\ntorrequest = [\"torrequest\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers can install with:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\npip install 'sherlock-project[torrequest]'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe remaining handling should be done in the code to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions.\r\n",

          "body": "Well, the discord one for example needs both logging in and it's not an indicator for a username. LinkedIn is another, you won't get a 404. There's a lot of great things in this data set, I know I'm willing to try to parse this all in to a data.json but I am just saying that there are some things that do need authentication and it's not as simple as a 404 check, the fact you have this collected in a nice JSON file makes a lot of this easy to test so I hope to come back to you with how many of these can work with sherlock. Some of the URL's also require a a UUID/Hash/ID on top of the name which also wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nIn another issue I mentioned the idea of adding support to sherlock to allow adding 'authentication modules' to some websites like LinkedIn so a user can be logged in and check the username instead of just getting redirected to the sign in instantly. \r\n",

          "body": "OK, I understand.  The other formatting changes were adding too much noise.\r\n\r\nAdding a new detection type would add too much churn to the code.  It also would make it harder to understand.  The current detection logic still needs major revisions to allow more flexibility in supporting new types without revamping.\r\n\r\nWhile the restructuring is not done, the direction I am planning is to have a set number of attributes for all sites, but then optional custom attributes for a specific detection method.  So, I restructured this as an additional attribute to the existing HTTP Status detection method.\r\n\r\nThis code has been included in #599 \r\n\r\nThanks!",

What would've made more sense was not adding the field in the json and instead checking the error code type prior to defining a HEAD request. This would automatically fix any future issues should another provider longer allow HEAD requests. I would've implemented this to start but was under the impression the rework would address this issue.",

Sometimes a site may take longer to respond, but a longer timeout will make the script takes to much time (waiting + retries) and the retries will usually handle intermittent connections.\r\n- Change Flipboard unclaimed username\r\n- Add a `tests/.excluded_sites` list to allow pass tests for unresponsive sites\r\n\r\n## Fixed issues\r\n\r\nThis PR shall fix these issues. \r\nIt would be nice if the reporters could check if they still persist.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/323 (@MinePro120)\r\n- https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/357 (@eanstandig41)",

I know that there are some now: this is one of the pains that I am having in doing the restructuring.\r\n\r\nI decided to make the timeout a command line option.  By default, the timeout will be disabled (just as it was before).  But, a user can specify something shorter if they like.\r\n\r\nI think that there are performance problems with some of the sites that have been added recently.  If that keeps up, they are going to have to be pruned.\r\n\r\nI am also seeing anomalies in how the timeout functions.  When I set the timeout to 90s, I get completion times of less than that, with multiple error connecting problems.  I think that there is something more basic causing problems: probably a manifestation of the problem noticed in #323.  I am thinking that the naive way that Sherlock spawns a thread for all sites at the beginning of the query is overwhelming people's computers.

You can make any other character upper case, and it finds it fine: it looks like it is only the first character that causes the problem.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what their username rules are.  In general, I cannot think of any time where a site will care about capitalization in their usernames: they would not want to allow users to have names that were so similar.  Maybe Sherlock should always convert the username to lower case before doing the query?\r\n\r\nThis is going to take more research.",

I installed the module into python but the installation seems to go to a file of python2.7 that came with Kali originally.  I have a few other ideas to install the module in python 3.7.  But at the moment... I'm still getting the same reading even with the new request module that I installed.  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks",

The purpose of this patch is not to make it an integral part of Sherlock, but rather to resolve an RC Bug in the project's repositories.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Feel free to accept it or not. My goal is to close the RC Bug, because if not, Sherlock will leave the \"Testing version\" of the distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. I only made a pull request because due to Debian's packaging policies, situations like this, it is recommended to communicate it upstream, either through \"issues\" or through PR. I chose PR so that DD Samuel wouldn't question it, since the Bug has already been reopened twice by him.\r\n\r\n 4.\r\nLet's wait for Samuel to review it before uploading the update.\r\nIn the same way, PR that will change the way of construction with Poetry.\r\n\r\nAnything and just contact me.\r\n\r\nStrong hug.\r\n\r\n",

We're appreciative of the PR, actually. We were in discussions about merging it as an interim fix while we got to more properly testing #2127. Only reason why we haven't merged this one is because in local testing it seems to introduce import errors, and we were unable to run it in the current state. Likely due to new relative paths caused by the new pyproject, which would be a pretty easy fix if so. I'll probably have more info for y'all shortly.",

          "body": "@kbarrett975 @Kamski18 It seems that Termux has issues building the `numpy` package wheel locally. The `pandas` package depends on `numpy`, so this error is generated when the build fails.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that this is a common problem in Termux, with several complaints on:\r\n\r\nlink 1: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/10808\r\nlink 2: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/3048\r\nlink 3: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77228553/error-cant-install-pandas-library-on-termux-2023\r\nlink 4: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/3225\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, to use the sherlock project in a Termux environment, you'll have to follow a few extra steps for now.\r\n\r\nFirst, update the package list and install updates:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npkg update && pkg upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvide the `y` option for all when prompted.\r\n\r\nThe Termux community provides a repository of pre-built Python packages, called `tur` (Termux User Repository). This will avoid having to build some packages locally.\r\n\r\nLet's install `tur-repo` and `build-essential`, which contains some necessary packages for building other packages:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npkg install build-essential tur-repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, force an update on the package list again:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npkg update\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let's install the pre-built `pandas` and `numpy` packages globally:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npkg install python-pandas python-numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install the packages. You can check using:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip list\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to install the sherlock project dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI personally recommend installing sherlock project dependencies in a virtual environment instead of globally to avoid conflicts with dependencies from other projects.\r\n\r\nTo create a virtual environment within the locally cloned sherlock project repository, use the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython -m venv --system-site-packages venv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `--system-site-packages` flag will copy the packages installed globally to the virtual environment in `venv`. This ensures that we have `pandas` and `numpy` within the virtual environment.\r\n\r\nTo activate the virtual environment, use the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsource venv/bin/activate\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you can install the sherlock project dependencies in this virtual environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you finish using sherlock, don't forget to deactivate the virtual environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeactivate\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've tested this, and it worked perfectly. I hope it works for you too. If you encounter any other problems, please let me know.\r\n\r\n**Refs:**\r\n\r\nref 1: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Python\r\nref 2: https://github.com/termux-user-repository/tur\r\nref 3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html",

To reduce the size simply run the cleanup in the same command like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRUN apk add --no-cache libxml2 \\\r\n && apk add -t .build-deps --no-cache g++ libxml2-dev \\\r\n && pip3 wheel -r /opt/sherlock/requirements.txt \\\r\n && apk del --purge .build-deps\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes if you update the requirements, you'd need to install again these packages, but that's quick and rare.\r\n",

I gave this issue a try and found the following:\r\n\r\n- After adding `RUN apk add --no-cache g++` to the Dockerfile, the issue was solved. g++ seems to be the minimal dependency needed to solve the issue.\r\n- I also implemented a solution using a Debian Slim Bullseye as the base image, as suggested by the discussion above. These were the results:\r\n    - The Debian image ended up with a size of 284MB. For comparison, the Alpine image with the solution I explained before had a final size of 344MB. A 60MB difference.\r\n    - The Debian image took a **considerably less** amount of time to build than the Alpine image. I didn't take the exact measurements, but the Alpine image seemed to take about 5 minutes to build, while the Debian image took <1 minute.\r\n\r\nI am ready to submit a PR with the implementation that you think is best. Please tell me what you think! :D",
