          "body": "@untitaker @ThiefMaster Thanks a lot for the review, I've gone through all your comments, so please take one more look.\n\nOne thing that's not clear to me is what is the reason for deprecating the `json` property (the changelog doesn't help much)? For me it's much more elegant to write `request.json['foo']` instead of `request.get_json()['foo']`, and properties are well-established in the Python community.\n\nI understand that there is some computation and caching hidden under the hood, but most people working with JSON APIs won't have to worry about that, and the rest can use the getters directly if they want to.\n",

          "body": "I suspect that I'm running into this as well.  Is this just the way it works?\n\nMaybe it would help matters if the stock [Blueprint example](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tree/master/examples/blueprintexample) was updated to show the intended way to run multiple blueprints.  The existing example doesn't seem to address what we are asking about in this issue.  I think it could be updated to show two different Blueprints, running side by side, with their own copy of /templates.  They both should have an index.html showing how to load one or the other from the Blueprint's-specified templates folder.  That way, we will understand clearly what is the intended way to do this. \n\nI'd do it myself, except I don't know if what I'm writing below is the intended way or if there actually is a bug here.  \n\nIt feels like:\n- `flask.render_template` ought to be searching the blueprint's `template_folder` first and then fall back to `app.template_folder` (and deal with the subsequent problem of caching internally)\n- or maybe the Blueprint class should have a render_template works like that (search the blueprint's `template_folder` first and then fall back to `app.template_folder`.\n\nFor my project, I am currently doing things as follows.  This is working, but it's messy because everything in mixed together in the `/templates` folder.\n\n```\n/myapp\n  /blueprint1\n    views.py\n  /blueprint2\n    views.py\n  /templates\n    /blueprint1\n      index.html\n    /blueprint2\n      index.html\n```\n\n_blueprint1/views.py_\n\n```\nbp = Blueprint('blueprint1', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='templates\")\n@bp.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return flask.render_template('blueprint1/index.html')\n```\n\n_blueprint2/views.py_\n\n```\nbp = Blueprint('blueprint2', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='templates\")\n@bp.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return flask.render_template('blueprint2/index.html')\n```\n\nSee how we have to specify the name of the blueprint path in render_template?  \n\nI was hoping for this to work instead:\n\n_blueprint1/views.py_\n\n```\nbp = Blueprint('blueprint1', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='blueprint1/templates\")\n@bp.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return flask.render_template('index.html')\n```\n\n_blueprint2/views.py_\n\n```\nbp = Blueprint('blueprint2', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='blueprint2/templates\")\n@bp.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return flask.render_template('index.html')\n```\n\nAn improvement is to add a render_template() function to the Blueprint object that is guaranteed to search the template_folder first and fall back to `app.template_folder` if it doesn't exist.\n\n```\nbp = Blueprint('blueprint2', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='blueprint2/templates\")\n@bp.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return bp.render_template('index.html')\n```\n\n**If I had a vote, I'd vote for this last idea** because I think it's the most clear.\n",

          "body": "No, this method first searches the blueprint template folder. Overriding of the blueprint templates would require some changes that I'm not sure how to do. The reason for this is that currently all the blueprint template folders are added to the global app search path. This means that loading from the app will try to load from any blueprint as well, which means another blueprint folder can be searched before the blueprint of the route that is actually used.\n\nThe above code fixes this by first searching the blueprint template folder and only after nothing is found it will search all other options. To fix this something would need to change in the app loader, which requires more work. Since I do not need overriding of templates I did not implement this. Feel free to change the code though.\n",

And there is also the complication of app factories, which are not friendly to `FLASK_APP` (https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2027).\r\n\r\nWhat I do, is define a `wsgi.py` file for each of my projects. I started adopting this as a convention, so I can have a hardcoded `FLASK_APP=wsgi.app` set in my `.profile` file and switch from app to app without worries. Would you consider implementing one or more sensible defaults for `FLASK_APP`? I think `wsgi.application` and `wsgi.app` are fairly common and could be defaults.",

Because you could also say \"how does one refer to their own app in production without creating an instance/settings.py file\", and then it becomes the same thing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this file needs to be on the production box for the app to be usable.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I use Docker and it has mechanisms for supplying an `.env` file of my choosing, then it makes those env variables available to the Flask app with no extra dirty work.\r\n\r\nWithout Docker, I would likely drop an environment file in `/etc/default/fooapp` which is the defaco-standard place on a Debian system to write out app-level environment variables. Then I would source that file in whatever init system I use.\r\n\r\nIn other words, in both development and production this env file would be available to the Flask app.\r\n\r\nIf this feature does end up being implemented, please let us configure the `.env` filename.\r\n\r\nI would much prefer to use env variables instead of config/instance files because it plays much nicer when trying to scale applications on infrastructures that let you define clusters of servers, but then can define env variables in a central area (outside of each individual host), and then they become available to all hosts without worrying about the logistics of getting an env file on the system.\r\n\r\nThis could be done now of course, but it kind of goes against the norm which is to use config/instance based config files instead of env variables.",

      "body": "This will require Python 2 support to be dropped, which as I understand isn't likely to happen till 2020. Which is a bonus as it gives time to consider this change and the implications of it. (I also need to spend some time cleaning up this implementation, yet it serves as a proof of concept).\r\n\r\nI've written [this blog post](https://pgjones.dev/blog/flask-async-quart-sync-2019/) to add some extra context, but I see a key aspect to this change is that whilst it adds `async` support it does not do so throughout and specifically does not support ASGI. This means that Flask is constrained (when using `async`) to have worse performance than the ASGI equivalents. This is necessary as I don't think Flask can be `async` throughout (or support ASGI) whilst being backwards compatible. Yet this change is good overall, in that users would be able to add some async usage to their existing codebases. I would also like to note that they can switch to Quart if their usage becomes mostly async. \r\n\r\nThis allows for async functions to be passed to the Flask class\r\ninstance, for example as a view function,\r\n\r\n    @app.route(\"/\")\r\n    async def index():\r\n        return \"Async hello\"\r\n\r\nthis comes with a cost though of poorer performance than using the\r\nsync equivalent.\r\n",

          "body": "Hey Phil!\r\n\r\nI know my views are different than many on this topic, but the main (only?) reason I would use an asynchronous server over a synchronous one is to achieve much higher scaling. This solution obviously does not address this problem, so this should be noted. I think the note about the performance is warranted, but just a partial aspect, the scaling limitations should be noted as well.\r\n\r\nA second thought is that it would be nicer if multiple async view functions could run concurrently in the asyncio thread, all under the same loop. I believe your implementation would allow only one async function to run at any given time. It seems there wouldn't be any problem in using a shared loop to run all of them concurrently, and that would eliminate some of the performance penalties in using this solution, I think.",

Even if you used a threaded server, the bottleneck is the single asyncio thread. You could make that size of 1 configurable, and then you can have some control over how many asyncio view functions can run concurrently, but that seems backwards to me.

          "body": "@davidism So it's still somewhat early to call victory on this, but if you want some details on what I have done...\r\n\r\nWhat Mike Bayer's gist made me realize is that you can do greenlet context switches within an asyncio task, and this allows us to interrupt standard functions and send control back to the asyncio loop. To test this out I added a [custom hub](https://eventlet.net/doc/hubs.html) class to eventlet that does all the waiting using asyncio primitives such as asyncio.add_reader, add_writer, etc.\r\n\r\nSince Flask runs great with greenlets, I can now run Flask on top of eventlet, which runs on top of asyncio! Here is some of the crazy things I've tested:\r\n\r\n- await for an async function in a normal Flask view function (without blocking, obviously):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/foo')\r\ndef foo():\r\n    await_(asyncio.sleep(1))\r\n    return 'Hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `await_` helper function uses `asyncio.create_task()` to launch the passed coroutine as a normal asyncio function, and then uses a greenlet based event to wait for it to complete w/o blocking.\r\n\r\n- use an async function as a Flask view function by decorating it with the same `await_` helper:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/foo')\r\n@await_\r\nasync def foo():\r\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n    return 'Hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\n- await a non-blocking standard function inside an async function. Here is requests.get() with eventlet monkey-patching:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/baz')\r\n@await_\r\nasync def baz():\r\n    rv = await make_awaitable(requests.get, 'https://google.com')\r\n    print(rv)\r\n    return 'Hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `make_awaitable()` helper function starts a greenlet on the requested function and waits for it to complete using a `asyncio.Future`.\r\n\r\nNone of this is Flask specific, actually. In fact I haven't had to hack on any official packages, this is all running on official Flask, greenlet and eventlet packages.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about this solution is that all of this works on a single OS thread, without executor tricks. It's truly an asyncio application that just has some \"under the table\" context switches done via `greenlet.switch()`. And the eventlet monkey-patching allows blocking functions in the Python standard library to run on top of asyncio and become awaitables.\r\n\r\nI hope I will have something that people can test and poke holes at soon.",

Running the event loop is the problem that this PR solves using a thread. \r\n\r\nIt isn't clear to me how the greenlet solutions help, as Flask has no event loop available to it and running an event loop in a thread is equivalent to this PR. \r\n\r\n@miguelgrinberg would I be correct in thinking that the Eventlet hub acts as an asyncio event loop substitute?

It's a single OS thread for eventlet's hub with all of its greenlets plus any normal asyncio stuff.\r\n\r\n> Actually reading further, I think you are running Flask within an asyncio loop?\r\n\r\nRight. So Flask runs as a greenlet, either under Eventlet's WSGI server, or with the monkey-patched Werzeug dev server. So each request is started on a greenlet. If you call this `await_` helper function then there is a switch to the eventlet hub's greenlet, which is an async function that has full access to await on things. And if you issue any I/O using eventlet functions, those are sent to the hub, which calls `asyncio.add_reader` or `asyncio.add_writer` to wait on the file descriptors using asyncio support.\r\n",

          "body": "> I think this PR is the right direction still as it allows the same functionality with any WSGI server .... Would you agree?\r\n\r\nWell, that's hard for me to say. I'm not a fan of this approach, since it does not give you scalability, which is often the reason why people go to asynchronous solutions. If you want to handle 1000 concurrent requests you need to allocate for 1000 threads or processes or a combination of them. A greenlet+asyncio solution would run like a proper async application, with just one OS thread. That to me is a huge benefit.\r\n\r\n> it allows the same functionality with any WSGI server rather than the Eventlet WSGI server, or the monkey-patched Werzeug dev server.\r\n\r\nThis I don't understand. The two servers that I mentioned are the ones that I tested so far, but there are really a lot of options, including gunicorn, waitress, maybe even meinheld. It could also work on uvicorn, and others like it once an ASGI wrapper is built for the `Flask` class. You could run the same application on WSGI or ASGI, using a mix of sync and async handlers. Deep down it is always going to be asyncio+greenlet running the show.\r\n\r\n> Also note that Quart allows the same as what you are describing without greenlets\r\n\r\nI don't think this is accurate. How would you use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension with Quart to talk to a MySQL db? Someone needs to write an asyncio version of all of that, which is an impossible task (literally the problem that Mike Bayer is trying to solve that started this odyssey). How would you use an API client that uses the requests library internally? Again, you have to wait for someone to do the work and port the code to async.\r\n\r\nBasically what I see here is that there is the potential to build a fairly transparent bridge between sync and async code that no other solution provides. If you don't like the greenlet way of doing async then I'm sure you will disagree with me on this, but out of all the options that have been mentioned in all these years this is the first one I'm excited about to build.",

          "body": "This is not an official justification for whatever pace the maintainers decide to take, but it might be that Flask is working well for what it was designed to do.  This is anecdotal, but I've been running a large Flask project for three years straight now, and no issue in that project has been because of Flask.  Another anecdote, of the 400+ questions I've answered about Flask on Stack Overflow, I can't think of any that were due to a real problem with Flask.  The community is obviously still active, and issues are discussed and problems solved.\n\nA (quick) glance at [pull requests created after the 0.10.1 release](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/pulls?q=updated%3A%3E2013-06-14+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged) (total 206) shows that they fall into a few categories.\n- Corrections to documentation or examples (often minor) (this is the _vast_ majority of the prs, there are whole pages where \"typo/docs/example\" are in every title)\n- Enhancements for convenience (often minor)\n- Truly new or different behavior (feature, deprecation, etc.) (I estimate 5, 2%)\n\nGetting a quick idea of other issues is more difficult, since they are just closed, there's nothing to merge to show that something was actually done.  From my experience following the tracker for a few years, the majority of them are support questions, denied reports, or request that turned into prs (many dealing with docs in some way).\n\nAgain, I cannot read the minds of the maintainers, but it seems entirely plausible to me that they don't feel that there is enough major content to make a release that they will have to officially support.  See mitsuhiko's [thoughts on this](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/11/28/emotional-programming/) (published soon after the 0.10.1 release).\n\n> The things I wrote over the last few years all work so well for _me_, that I don't need to fix problems or add things.\n\nPerhaps if people could point to specific bugs or enhancements that are vital to them using Flask, those issues could be added to the milestone to give it more weight.  Just saying \"I want a new release\" isn't as effective without saying _why_.  It would be great to see more statistics about what a new officially supported release would gain everyone.\n",

However, the previous release 0.10.1 is two years old and until the next release, the 761 commits in master won't be very useful.\n\nI really like to see a release of Flask to use the new CLI feature. Last year (around august 2014), click 2.0 support has been merged so I started to use Flask master in the hope of a imminent release but now, one year later, I rewrote my CLI commands with argparse to not depend of an unreleased version anymore (I don't want to publish my own Flask package on a private pypi). Frequent releases (even minors) give me more confidence in the project.\n",

I really want to push out a release very soon however, but I might change the version number from 1.0 away to something slightly less emotional.\n\nThe 1.0 release should at least go with an updated documentation and website and I currently do not have the time for that part (any volunteers? :D)\n",

Another part of my goal is for me to gain a better understanding of devcontainers in general, so I appreciate your patience in this respect.\r\n\r\n>How can I get a codespace without VSCode installing every extension I have locally as well?\r\n\r\nThis is a question I have as well, and will bring to my team.\r\n\r\n>The virtualenv is not activated in the terminal that is opened when I create the dev container.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned [here](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4969#discussion_r1110473576), the venv will activate in any new terminal. This is why I added the venv activation step to the custom welcome text, and added the `environmentChangesRelaunch` setting to prevent the welcome text being cleared away. This may not be necessary with the change I implemented below.\r\n\r\n>I'm excited for Codespaces as a way to onboard contributors, but if this is the experience of just getting a basic Python environment working (Flask is really basic compared to most projects), I'm not confident I'm going to be able to maintain this, and I'm worried I'll get more user confusion.\r\n\r\nBecause this _is_ a simple project with few dependencies, I removed the `postCreateCommand` and instead pushed installation tasks into the `onCreateCommand`. This means that loading the codespace will take more time up front (in the loading screen), but once users are in the container they can start working right away. This should help minimize confusion.\r\n\r\nI hope that by putting in the effort to find the right configuration for Flask, we can more easily add codespaces support for the other Pallets projects!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "I'm about to merge this, I think it's in a good enough place for contributors at this point. I'm going to run a sprint at PyCon two weeks from now, so I'll get more feedback then. @emisargent have you reported any feedback so far to GitHub? Where can I follow discussions/issues? And where should I provide more feedback in the future?\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of the issues I'd like to see improved:\r\n\r\n- `/usr/local/etc/vscode-dev-containers/first-run-notice.txt` is not documented. It doesn't have any effect in generic dev containers, only on codespaces. It's not possible to disable the message completely.\r\n- VS Code opens up and becomes usable before setup is finished. It should be possible to wait until the environment and IDE is completely set up before allowing the user to interact with it.\r\n- It's not possible to disable installing all the extensions I have installed locally, which greatly slows down the IDE setup and exacerbates the \"wait for virtualenv\" issue.\r\n- At PyCascades, @crazy4pi314 tried to create a custom Docker image instead, so that the virtualenv already existed as early as possible. However, it seems like again Codespaces is not behaving the same as devcontainers, or at least isn't documenting things enough. The big issue was that it wasn't possible to know/create the user that generic/codespace/jetbrains would use in the container, to have everything owned by the correct user. She probably has some more notes that I've forgotten.\r\n- I tried pushing to this PR in a codespace, and both `git push` in the terminal and the panel UI prompted to create a fork instead. That's good for most users, except that I'm a maintainer so I should be able to push directly to your branch, but it's not recognizing that in the codespace.\r\n- There's no documentation about how forks and remotes are set up with codespaces. It looks like an `upstream` remote is added for this PR, with your fork as the origin. But is that the case when a new contributor clicks on the codespaces button without creating a fork first? Does GitHub create the fork automatically like it does with the current simple editor?",

Otherwise everybody would have to replace `json` with `get_json()` in existing code for no obvious benefit, or simply ignore warnings.\n- More concise and readable for the common use cases (compare `request.json['foo']` with `request.get_json()['foo']`).\n- Consistent with `request.form` and `request.data` (both have properties in addition to getters).\n- The default behaviour for both `json` and `get_json()` is to cache the data, so there is no real reason to encourage calling it only once.\n- Advanced users who need more control can still use `get_data()` and `get_json()` directly.\n\nThere could be a way to make the errors more helpful when mixing both `json` and `data` in a single view function (which is the only rationale for this deprecation that I've heard so far).\n",

          "body": "Accessing `.json` drains the input stream which is problematic if people want to use specific processing for that data.  While the same is true for `.files` and `.form` they have their own internal support systems for hooking and are so common that it does not really matter.  `.json` however is highly problematic because untrusted incoming JSON data is questionable due to its nested nature.\n\nHonestly, larger projects should never really accept JSON data verbatim like this but with a validating parser which however is largely out of the scope for Flask.  At Fireteam we used to parse JSON data with a stream processor and for that it's very important that accidentally touching a property does not entirely bypass this.\n",

It's not obvious how using unvalidated JSON is any more dangerous than using unvalidated form data.\n\nIf a project needs to do something different, they can already use a different deserializer, a different request object, or just make sure not to access the property, along with other properties with this behavior.  I think it is preferable to keep the convenience and consistency of `.json` and call out the fact that some properties drain the input.\n",

I changed it so that both `jsonify(1,2,3)` and `jsonify([1,2,3])` serialize to `[1,2,3]` as I think that's the more intuitive behavior.\n- Per the discussion in #1209 & #248, I didn't create a separate config variable to modify this behavior. \n\nI know it'd be nice to incorporate a fix for #1443 in here as well, but I don't fully understand the issue there. So let's get this merged, and then tackle that issue in a followup PR.\n\nFix #170, #248, #510, #673, #1177 and check one of the boxes on #1182 \n",

          "body": "Agreed. \n\n`json.dumps()` only accepts the first item and appears to silently drop the others, so I considered copying that. It might be more natural as most people are used to the `dumps()` API. \n\nHowever, `jsonify()` currently accepts `**kwargs`, so I decided handling `*args` this way was more internally consistent.\n\nOverall, I think the divergence in accepted input between `json.dumps()` and `jsonify()` creates more confusion than convenience. Right now I sometimes forget which one supports `kwargs` and which supports arrays. And I'm not the only one who has [trouble remembering](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7907596/json-dumps-vs-flask-jsonify). \n\nSplitting behavior so `jsonify()` rejects `*args` but happily handles `**kwargs` just adds to the confusion, so we should pick either of the following:\n1. Make `jsonify()` internally consistent so it accepts both `*args` and `**kwargs`. \n2. Make `jsonify()` consistent with `dumps()`, meaning they both only accept a single argument. This implies a long term plan to deprecate  `jsonify(**kwargs)` so that it throws an exception just like `dumps(**kwargs)`.\n\nI don't care strongly, but if I had to pick I'd choose the latter because it's simpler to think of `jsonify()` as a `json.dumps()` that adds Flask niceties like the response class and serializing datetimes/UUIDs.\n",

          "body": "> Maybe the solution to this mess is to introduce a new function that just invokes json.dumps and makes a response. Same behavior as json.dumps but with different name and makes a response object.\n\nIs there any reason to create a new function vs just modifying the existing `jsonify()` function? \n\nIt breaks backwards compatibility, but for a 1.0 release that should be fine. Also, I know in my own projects, I've never intentionally used `jsonify(**kwargs)`, I've just always passed it a dict, and I suspect most people use it similarly.\n\nTo me, the path of least surprise is to stay with the current `jsonify()` function name and remove the `**kwargs` support to be consistent with `dumps()`.\n\nThe other nicety that `jsonify()` currently has is serializing datetimes & UUIDs. If they weren't already in there, I wouldn't add them, but since they are in there, I'd just leave it in. \n",

That behavior is a bit more loose than `dumps()`, but I think it's more convenient for the user and unlikely to trip up anyone unexpectedly. If anything, copying `dumps(1,2,3)` by serializing `jsonify(1,2,3)` to `1` is more likely to trip up someone. \n\n> Shouldn't jsonify with both args and kwargs fail?\n\nStill a very valid question, but I don't want it to delay merging this PR. For now, let's just stick with Flask's current behavior which is to accept both `args` and `kwargs` and serialize them to a dict. We can discuss changing that behavior in a separate issue or PR.\n",

The docs for the `jsonify` function can be improved.\n\nNote that as a side effect, simple types are accepted as well (`True`, `3.14`, etc.), so there should be a test/doc for that too.  Test both a single and multi character string.\n\nNot sure if I like that `*args` will be treated as an array, if it was me I'd make it always explicit, but it's not a huge deal.\n",

          "body": "Some updates:\n1. Added tests.\n2. Moved around the existing `jsonify()` tests so they're located next to each other--before they were a little scattered. Other than relocating, I made minimal changes to existing tests.\n3. Expanded the docs for `jsonify()`. I'm not very familiar with RST/sphinx, so there might be some formatting issues I missed.\n4. Restructured the code handling the `*args`/`**kwargs` to be more explicit and linear. Previously, it wasn't always clear which combinations of `*args`/`**kwargs` would throw an exception and cause the `try`/`except` block to switch from dict to array.\n5. As part of this restructuring, made it so passing `args` + `kwargs` at the same time to `jsonify()` will fail as suggested by @ThiefMaster. After thinking about it more, I agree that this is the least surprising outcome rather than silently dropping either the `args` or `kwargs`.\n\nFeedback welcome. \n",

          "body": "Thanks for taking a look at this @untitaker. The idea is the user wouldn't have to worry about malfunction caused by arbitrary JSON libraries, because with the proposed changes, they could actually control which library is being used, and not worry about subtle side effects caused by transitive dependencies changing behavior unexpectedly.\n\nWith the current situation, it's possible to have your app working fine one minute, and then you install some package which installs simplejson as a transitive dependency, and then all of a sudden your app breaks in some unrelated place. (This happened to me.:)\n\nWhen [this code](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/41622c8d681a170f39df2ab8dff170d3b8d2d139/flask/json.py#L22-L25) was originally written, was the json library landscape different, and now that there are more good options, Flask should allow the user to override its default?\n\nTo be clear, the current `try/except ImportError` code leading to unexpected results is a separate (but related) issue. But by removing the silent fallback import, just having one good, deterministic default, and allowing the user to explicitly opt in if they want something different, we can address both issues at once in an elegant way.\n\nDoes that make any sense?\n",

If Flask's user base is now primarily on 2.6+, it sounds like a consistency win to at least change the order of the imports in the try/except.\n\nBut if we're talking about changes for 1.0, I think that could be a reasonable time to converge on stdlib json as the default Flask uses, and if any other json library is needed (either because you're in the minority still stuck on 2.5 or you need the speed of rapidjson or whatever else), Flask offers a setting for it.\n",

          "body": "> json has various problems in different versions of Python which we so far got away with by using simplejson when available\n\nAh, thanks for explaining Armin. From the [slash escape](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/41622c8d681a170f39df2ab8dff170d3b8d2d139/flask/json.py#L28-L30) thing it looks like different versions of simplejson can cause annoying differences too?\n\n> any strong reasons for not requiring simplejson?\n\nI guess this would at least allow Flask to peg to a specific version range to have better consistency guarantees, yeah?\n\n> Do you have some examples of what's different with default?\n\nBefore I had simplejson installed, I was providing Flask a custom JSON encoder class that overrode `default` to work around rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3301 and the workaround worked. With simplejson installed, the `r.binary` values that were causing the issue were getting intercepted by [this code](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/2510da1961f95ea7d642d1b61bcd270b90962f54/simplejson/encoder.py#L624-L626) (since `isinstance(r.binary, bytes)`), so they no longer were getting passed to my overridden `default` method, causing encoding errors.\n\nDoes this example demonstrate a need for better consistency guarantees in the json handling? Thanks so much again for taking a look.\n",

See the issue from `requests` to read more about the details, but the short of it is that HTTP headers are supposed to only accept `latin-1` characters. Changing this behavior in flask or werkzeug would only cause issues and break running code by allowing requests to be sent in an unsupported encoding to webservers which expect to get `latin-1`.\n\nSomeone else can chime in if I am mistaken, but I think this can be closed.\n\nSimilar discussion:\nhttps://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1926\nhttps://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/issues/212\n",

          "body": "The claim that message flashing is broken and especially the claim that messages could be flashed to the wrong client is not at all obvious. Such a strong claim should be backed by argument, preferrably in the form of a reproducible test case. To understand what \"broken\" even means you should also describe _exactly_ how you are using flashing, what you expect to happen and what is happening instead.\n\nI personally think message flashing should be implemented as an extension, nevertheless it isn't and removing it, creates a backwards incompatibilty. This means that the cost of removing message flashing or rather moving the functionality to an extension is very expensive for the Flask community while the gain is purely aesthetic and therefore -- at least in this case -- neglible. In other words: it definitely should not be removed.\n\nFurthermore a \"user account system\" is definitely outside the scope, especially if it is \"piss-poor\". The non-essential utilities Flask provides, come with the same dangers for the Flask ecosystem as the Python stdlib has for the entire Python ecosystem. These utilities will be used by everyone, even if a better solution exists and therefore are a potential danger to the code quality of any Flask project and innovation in the Flask ecosystem. We should keep the number of these utilities small, they should be of excellent quality and solve problems using solutions that have preferrably no potential for improvement.\n",

I am pretty certain this doesn't solve enough problems, so it was rather brainstorming than anything else.\n\n> If you update Flask and your app breaks because of changes to the Flask API, then there is breakage.\n\nSince every change to Flask's codebase could potentially break somebody's application, i am not sure if your definition is as useful as it is simple to understand. AFAIK we've also done some deliberate API changes during the Python 3 rewrite and after it, e.g. the `get_data()` thing on request objects.\n\n@mcilrain:\n\n> Why is a so-called microframework dictating frontend design decisions?\n\nI'm going to assume the repetition of that sentence wasn't deliberate, and i really hope to be right.

If I'm wrong on that assumption, please let me know. I think the problem with giving no flashing or equivalent functionality in examples/flask is the fact that inexperienced developers will make, arguably, worse implementations.\n\nWhile I understand the only thing that's going to make you happy is a total deletion of flashing, IMO the special case you're describing doesn't feel warranted for a removal of a well-used feature. If it doesn't work for your system, you can always override or not use it. right?\n\nMaybe just add to the flask docs warning of unreliability of flash message retrieval?\n",

          "body": "Could we please stop with the hyperbolic bullshit? Message flashing in Flask can produce a possibly unwanted result in exactly two cases:\n1. The user makes a request producing flashed messages in tab A.\n2. The browser receives a response (most likely a redirect) with the flashed messages.\n3. The user makes a request in another tab B _before_ or in _parallel_ with the request that will be made from tab A, to a page that displays flashed messages.\n4. The server answers the request from tab B before the (likely occurring) request from tab A.\n5. Flashed messages appear in B instead of A.\n\nI dare you to actually manage triggering this case, I suspect that in almost all cases the timeframe you have to trigger this case, is shorter than your reaction time.\n\nThe second far more interesting case:\n1. The user makes a request producing flashed messages in browser A.\n2. The browser receives a response (most likely a redirect) with the flashed messages.\n3. The browser syncronizes the received cookie with browser B (which I suspect is not going to happen after every request for a huge number of good reasons.)\n4. The user makes a request in browser B, to a page that displays flashed messages.\n5. The server answers the request from browser B before the (likely occurring) request to browser A.\n6. Flashed messages appear in B instead of A.\n\nAgain I would like to dare you to try triggering this case.\n\nI would also like you to consider that it might be more important not to lose the information in a flashed message and would therefore want to display messages to the user, even if that's not possible on the page the user was redirected to.\n\nThe latter part becomes really interesting, if we consider the case of a user stopping the usage of one device and continues to use the a web page on another. This might occur, if someone leaves their home and continues to use a page from a phone instead of their desktop computer or if someone merely moves from their desk to their sofa on which they prefer to use a tablet. In these cases a seamless transition is desired and this might very well include displaying flashed messages, which might signal a failure of some action, to which the user might want to react.\n\nThis is not at all a case of broken or not, this is a case of trade-offs in complexity and possible use cases. The implementation Flask uses, has sane, easily explained and consistent behaviour. There is nothing broken or bad about it nor is it at all clear that it shouldn't be used.\n\nI'm not opposed to breaking backwards compatiblity, quite the opposite in fact. Nevertheless if you do that, you should have a good reason. Introducing Python 3 support was one such reason, the purely theoretical case of someone perfoming a request when using a Flask application, within a certain timeframe possibly a few hundred ms long and then may be getting flashed messages at a different location than possibly intended, is anything but a good reason.\n\nThis has devolved to what is at best an exercise in mental masturbation over some theoretical aesthetically perfect solution to _flashing messages_ that nobody has even come up with. So unless someone can actually show that is is indeed a problem and not just a theoretical one and that it can be reasonably solved just please stop this bullshit.\n",

Roll your own if you need better, and if it's really good, contribute to the repo. At your same argument Flask shouldn't have functions to use Jinja templates, because if I don't use Jinja, then its just wasted code that I don't need.\n\n> But there's message flashing functionality that will mostly go unused...\n\nDo you have statistics on flash usage?\n\nTo just remove because YOU don't use this implimentation with no replacement, be that in core or an extension, seems nitpicky.\n",

This also allows overriding per `open` call (or `make_test_environ_builder` call).\n\nPerhaps a better solution would be to edit werkzeug directly and add it to that init (which, in turn, would allow us to remove the subclass init). I don't believe that would cause any unintended behavior, but I'm open to further conversation on it.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/pallets/flask/2047)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

          "body": "I think that dontcare4free's NestableBlueprint provides a good rough design. All that would really be needed is the ability to register blueprints onto an already existing blueprint. I don't think this would really change any code in Blueprint.register() either since, from looking at that and BlueprintSetupState, the same function names are shared between Blueprint and Flask. Looks like it'd be mostly a duplication of register_blueprint from Flask to Blueprint.\n\nHere is how I'd envision Blueprint.register_blueprint would work:\n\nEach blueprint would have its own self.blueprints dict. When register_blueprint is called, it would check whether there is a blueprint with that name already in its internal dict. The logic on what to depending on that result do is duplicated between Flask.register_blueprint and Blueprint.register_blueprint. However, the ID of the child blueprint would have the id of the parent blueprint appended to it, with a '.' between the two. For example, if the parent blueprint was named 'config' and the child blueprint was named 'users', then ultimately its ID would be 'config.users'. Any paths in the child would be prefixed by the parent blueprint's url_prefix as well as the child's.\n\nThis is equally as rough as the dontcare4free's design above, and I haven't looked thoroughly through the code to see everywhere that this could affect, but it is possible to do.\n",

By not having a copy of `environ` when using `copy_current_request_context` with threads, it is possible for an old request to get data from a new request (in flask 1.0.2) (e.g., `request.method`).  Such behavior seems to be justified by the code comment of the `RequestContext` `copy` function when it says \"Because the actual request object is the same this cannot be used to move a request context to a different thread unless access to the request object is locked.\".  This indicates that `flask.copy_current_request_context` was previously meant to do a shallow copy and any deep copy functionality should require a boolean flag argument or a separate function.\r\n\r\nI would like to use `flask.copy_current_request_context` if it was copying the `request` `environ`, so I would suggest adding a `deep` boolean keyword argument (defaulting to `False`) to the `RequestContext` `copy` function which is utilized when a boolean flag is passed to `flask.copy_current_request_context`.  However, I know that is separate from @dchevell 's pursuit of a session copy.",

I am not sure if it needs a separate PR because they both seem related and it seems like people would likely want both to get a deep copy.  `flask.copy_current_request_context` seems like a name that covers both a shallow copy and a deep copy, so it seems like it needs a function argument to switch between the different behavior.  For the request copy, when not modifying `RequestContext` `copy`, I found it necessary to modify `flask.copy_current_request_context` so it looks like:\r\n\r\n    def _copy_current_request_context(function):\r\n        top = _request_ctx_stack.top\r\n        if top is None:\r\n            raise RuntimeError('This decorator can only be used at local scopes '\r\n                               'when a request context is on the stack.  '\r\n                               'For instance within view functions.')\r\n        reqctx = top.copy()\r\n        # environ is used by headers too, so only a copy of environ is necessary\r\n        reqctx.request.environ = reqctx.request.environ.copy()\r\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\r\n            with reqctx:\r\n                return function(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        return update_wrapper(wrapper, function)\r\n\r\nIt should be better to modify `RequestContext` `copy` to do the `environ` copy if a `deep` keyword argument is passed.",

The idea here is that we no longer try to map the development mode from the production mode by the `DEBUG` setting. This is intended because we want users to be able to are in a non debug development mode.\r\n\r\nThe docs are updated to largely refer to `FLASK_ENV` only.\r\n\r\nOne change to node is that we default to production instead of defaulting to development. This is done because most people will not set the environment and we do not want users to accidentally have debug features on.\r\n\r\nThis refs #2569",

My current thinking is that separately we should do a few changes to the run command to make it make sense in production.\r\n\r\nThe first one I think makes sense that for `FLASK_ENV` != `development` it should print a scary warning to stderr and point out that it's bad. Additionally it should really have a configurable backend one can hook in. In particular I think it would be great if it can automatically spawn a uwsgi through a plugin which is really what most people do at this point.",

      "body": "I don't have a good description for the issue yet but one of the issues I keep running into myself in 2017 is that it's not convenient to marry Flask and webpack. The issue here is that one wants to both have a server app as well as a client app and each uses a hot reloader for code.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of boilerplate to make two services work and there is absolutely no support on the side of Flask to make it work. So here is what Flask most likely should do:\r\n\r\n# Environment Awareness\r\n\r\nFlask needs to know about environments. For now I would propose to mirror the node model where we have an environment flag and depending on the environment flag some flags get flipped automatically. In development for instance we would turn on debug by default. This discourages apps to make too many assumptions about the debug flag but instead use an environment flag instead.\r\n\r\nThis means debug can be flipped on and off in development mode. A potential webpack integration extension can then forward that flag to webpack.\r\n\r\n# Proxy or be-proxied Capabilities\r\n\r\nRight now one either needs front/backend to be running different servers on different ports or use some manual proxy setup to make this work. Right now the webpack server can pass through to the Flask server but it's quite hacky and non trivial.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal case Flask in development mode can spawn another process (like a webpack server, ngrok etc.) and manage this process. It would work independently of the Flask reloader but shut down together.\r\n\r\nIf it spawns a process on a different port Flask should itself be proxied through that other server or proxy to another server if that's easier. This would most likely require that the Werkzeug server learns HTTP proxying as we might not be able to do this on the WSGI level.",

The environment is then forwarded to other development tools as well (such as node based ones as `NODE_ENV`).\r\n\r\nThe main motivation is that you want to have software run in development without having debug on or to have debug on in production like environments (staging).\r\n\r\nThe `FLASK_ENV` would be used to turn on the webpack live reloader etc. / turning minifiers off without having to have debug mode enabled. This is important for when you want to collaborate with others through things such as ngrok without worrying about potential security issues coming up from debug turned on.",

          "body": "Right now my thinking process is something like this: Flask gets a `buildprocess` decorator which registers a thing by name as a build process. This can either be an external build process or just a thread. It gets a unique key it's identified with.\r\n\r\nUpon reload new build processes are loaded and old ones are discarded.\r\n\r\nSomething like this maybe:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.buildprocess(key='webpack')\r\ndef webpack(process):\r\n    config = 'config.%s.js' % app.env\r\n    p = subprocess.Popen(['build-process', config], cwd=...)\r\n    process.register_wait(p.wait)\r\n    process.register_exit(p.terminate)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere might be nice helpers for making this nicer when actual subprocesses are involved. When the app is first loaded all build processes are registered with the development server. When the app is reloaded all processes that are no longer needed are closed by invoking the exit functions. A build process either has to quit immediately or watch in the background. Still need to decide on how this is controlled, maybe a flag is passed that indicates background watching mode. Likewise the process should pass ports over if proxying is wanted.",

Proxying asset requests to `webpack-dev-server`;\r\n 2. Generating a JSON manifest for production deployment;\r\n 3. Automatically executing `webpack --watch` when the dev server is run;\r\n\r\nIs there a particular reason why you'd like to use `webpack-dev-server` over serving the resulting bundles normally?\r\nThe work that @lnielsen did in `flask-webpackext`, and which I've been building on to integrate webpack into Indico, doesn't involve the dev server at all. Bundles are served from Flask, from a URL path that is customizable. It also creates a config file that `webpack.config.js` can read and which includes path/URL information.\r\n\r\nAs for 2, we're using `ManifestPlugin`, which the extension can parse and conveniently use from templates. E.g. `{{ webpack['common'] }}` will generate a corresponding `<script>` tag.",

          "body": "> Definitely interested in lending a hand, if needed.\r\n\r\nSame here.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can decode from the discussion it should be fairly easy to integrate [Flask-WebpackExt](https://flask-webpackext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with the ``@app.buildprocess()`` decorator and ``FLASK_ENV`` variable. \r\n\r\nOnce you have the ``buildprocess()`` decorator I'm happy to give it a try and integrate it with Flask-WebpackExt.\r\n\r\nWould the ``buildprocess()`` decortaor run the proccess during a ``flask run`` or via something like ``flask build``?\r\n\r\n**Spawning build process**\r\nFlask-WebpackExt is depending on [pynpm](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/pynpm) and [pywebpack](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/pywebpack) to do most of the work. We would likely need to change ``pynpm`` to allow outputting the ``cmdline`` for ``build_config.spawn(cmdline, ..)`` instead of actually running the command.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n```python\r\n# FROM:\r\nfrom pynpm import NPMPackage\r\npkg = NPMPackage('path/to/package.json')\r\npkg.run_script('build', '--report')\r\n# TO:\r\nfrom pynpm import NPMPackage\r\npkg = NPMPackage('path/to/package.json', run=False)\r\ncmdline = pkg.run_script('build', '--report')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see it as positive that Flask could provide some API to run the command line. \r\n\r\n**``FLASK_ENV`` to ``NODE_ENV``**\r\n\r\nFlask-WebpackExt (optionally) allows you to inject a ``config.json`` into your webpack build directory, so you can provide webpack with access to [debug flag, paths and URLs](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/flask-webpackext/blob/master/flask_webpackext/project.py#L25-L43). It should be trivial to add the ``FLASK_ENV`` there or on the ``cmdline``.\r\n\r\nYou can see an [example application](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/flask-webpackext/blob/master/examples/app.py) using Flask-WebpackExt. \r\n\r\nBasically, you point ``Flask-WebpackExt`` to your Webpack project's ``package.json``, and then commands like ``flask webpack install`` and ``flask webpack build``, will run the corresponding NPM commands/scripts.\r\n\r\nIf your Webpack project generates a ``manifest.json`` (via some of the available plugins) Flask-WebpackExt can read this ``manifest.json`` and make them available in templates (e.g. ``{{ webpack['main.js'] }}``). This is only useful if your Flask app needs to serve the assets, and works similar to the way @lepture [described](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2569#issuecomment-353926613).\r\n  ",

I've tried simply invoking the code you shared on `flask.request` in place of `request`, but that isn't sufficient to avoid the runtime error. Also, I'm seeing the runtime error for files that don't import request. A file with only this flask import has the same issue: `from flask import current_app as app`.\n",

If I get this working, I could file a PR.\n\nI moved flaskr.py into a new folder \"flaskr\" and created an empty __init__.py file. I then created the following setup.py file:\n\n```\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n        name='flaskr',\n        description='Simple microblog example using Flask',\n        packages=find_packages(),\n        entry_points='''\n                [flask.commands]\n                initdb=flaskr.flaskr:initdb_command\n        ''',\n)\n```\n\nIn a new conda environment, I installed the development version of flask and did a pip install of the flaskr folder containing the setup.py. Now when I run `flask initdb`, I get the following error.\n\n```\nUsage: flask initdb [OPTIONS]\n\nError: Failed to find application in module \"flaskr\".  Are you sure it contains a Flask application?  Maybe you wrapped it in a WSGI middleware or you are using a factory function. \n```\n\nAny hints on where to go next? I'm looking at the [docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/cli/#custom-commands), and it seems like this should work now.\n",

These steps:\n\n```\nexport FLASK_APP=flaskr\nexport FLASK_DEBUG=1\nflask run\n```\n\nWill never work because there is no way for Python to find the flaskr.py file. The fix we are using is:\n\n```\nexport PYTHONPATH=`pwd`\n```\n\nOr similar, and then of course the tutorial works. In the past the tutorial used to involve using python to run the flaskr.py file itself, not sure why this changed to the 'flask' binary but the change means people can't complete the tutorial...thereby damaging Flask's reputation!\n",

          "body": "Good call @TomIsPrettyCoool.\nSo this is a bug in the reloader - note that windows finds `flask` when prompted to, although it's `flask.exe`. the werkzeug reloader probably calls `flask` instead of `flask.exe`.\nI imagine there are two ways to solve this: (1) fix the reloader to use `flask.exe` on windows; (2) add batch file called `flask` next to `flask.exe` during flask install. (2) is probably easier and contained in flask, but (1) might solve future bugs for other packages.\n",

      "body": "In order to run a Flask application during development we have the `.run()` method or with 1.0 `flask run`. While both are convenient they are a bad idea.\n\nFirst of all their naming implies that, they are used for running a Flask application, they aren't. They are for running a Flask application during development, a subtle but important difference that causes significant confusion. Apart from that though, running a Flask application is never what you want.\n\nInstead you want to _develop_, _test_ or _deploy_ an application. While development and testing can imply running a web server, running a web server during development means something different than running a web server during testing. In deployment you don't actually want to run your application at all, you should let a web server do that.\n\nSo far we kind of allow people to signal their intent with DEBUG and TESTING, but this needs to be explicitly configured by every user and issues such as #1049, show that this is not without issues.\n\nTherefore what I would like to propose is to create three commands `develop`, `test` and `deploy`. These commands should be extendable through extensions and users. It should be easily possible to use different configurations for these scenarios.  Extensions that are only helpful during development like Flask-Debugtoolbar could activate/deactivate themselves based on intent, Flask-Migrate could perform migrations during development and extensions dealing with assets could start background threads monitoring the file system for changes during development. It would further simply clear up a lot of confusion for newcomers.\n\nRunning flask with either of these commands should by default set `DEVELOPMENT` (for backwards compatibilty also DEBUG but let's remove that, the name is awful), `TESTING` or `DEPLOYMENT` respectively and issue a signal. Furthermore `develop` should run the development server as `run` does now. `test` and `deployment` shouldn't actually test or deploy the application as we don't want to enforce a specific test runner or deployment solution. Instead the user should be implement these, if so desired. Nevertheless they would be useful as they establish convention extensions can rely on.\n\nI realize that such a change is probably somewhat controversial (which is why this is not a pull request), it would also distinguish us significantly from Django, which works like Flask does now. Nevertheless I think it would be a great idea and I'm curious what others think of this idea. So, thoughts?\n",

It is not just about how to run a web server, but also how to manage your machines. For small teams, a `fabric` would be enough.

Thought I would take 5 and send in a PR for it.\n\nI prefer the simple approach of always printing a short warning when `run()` is used, then making it easy for the app developer to find the docs on using a production WSGI server. Not renaming preserves compatibility, but also gives us the opportunity to point people in the right direction in the form of the warning.\n\nThanks for Flask!\n",

There is enough knowledge of many languages that that shouldn't be the problem. It's just the fact that our manager is quite focused on PHP, because \"everybody is using it\". I'll be mainly building this part (an internal website) on my own, with maybe others joining in later. Seeing that I have experience in it, it makes sense for me to build it in Python (and Flask). I know that others will take over in a later stage, but that shouldn't withhold us to choose a technology in which prototyping is blazingly fast, and which is simply awesome (I know, my opinion).\n\nAnyway, no tips for nice websites which use Flask?\n",

I have reproduced this with two different WSGI servers (gunicorn and twisted), both of which handle chunked data appropriately. Non-chunked data does not suffer this problem. I've reproduced this problem on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe following Flask application demonstrates the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import Flask, request\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\r\ndef hello_world():\r\n    return request.data\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen run like this: `gunicorn -w 4 example:app`.\r\n\r\nThe following test script can be run:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\ndef gen():\r\n    yield b\"hello\"\r\n    yield b\"world\"\r\n\r\nprint(\"Making first request\")\r\nr = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/', data=b'helloworld')\r\nprint(\"Got: %s\" % r.content.decode('utf-8'))\r\nprint(\"Making second request\")\r\nr = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/', data=gen())\r\nprint(\"Got: %s\" % r.content.decode('utf-8'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Output\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaking first request\r\nGot: helloworld\r\nMaking second request\r\nGot: helloworld\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Output\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaking first request\r\nGot: helloworld\r\nMaking second request\r\nGot: \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n% python -VV                                      \r\nPython 3.6.0 (default, Jan 18 2017, 18:08:34) \r\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n% pip freeze                                      \r\nappdirs==1.4.3\r\nclick==6.7\r\nFlask==0.12.1\r\ngunicorn==19.7.1\r\nitsdangerous==0.24\r\nJinja2==2.9.6\r\nMarkupSafe==1.0\r\npackaging==16.8\r\npyparsing==2.2.0\r\nsix==1.10.0\r\nWerkzeug==0.12.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nThis was spotted at httpbin.

If the answer is \"servers must support the relevant werkzeug extension\" then that's fine, but that needs to be documented really clearly somewhere to make it clear to server authors that if they don't implement it then Flask won't see any chunked bodies. Alternatively, Flask/werkzeug could implement some heuristics regarding headers and the first few bytes of the body to try to work out what the server is doing.\r\n\r\nI don't mind at all what direction you choose to go. \ud83d\ude01",

The name of the command has been changed to `flask_ext_migrate` to make it more specific\n3. The test module import was changed to reflect that `scripts` is now a top-level package\n4. An unused import statement was removed from the test module (Thanks @ThiefMaster).\n\nI feel that having `scripts` as a top-level package simplifies usage of the tool and also allows for further command line tool development downstream. Is this bad practice though? I can certainly change it.\n",

Another simple example on other folder structure\r\n\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n   __init__.py\r\n   templates/\r\n   models/\r\n   controllers/  (or other names)\r\n```",

The quick start is the minimal amount to start the app, i.e, writing a short app and running `flask run`. I think it makes sense for the tutorial to aim for people who want to learn how to structure their app correctly. In the tutorial case it makes sense to add more detail and isn't exactly a quick start. The 0.12 tutorial isn't really a quick start either. ",

It may be a great pattern later on when building Flask apps but it seems quite complex and you don't really go into a lot of reasoning as to WHY its needed.  \r\n\r\nI am new to Flask but not Python and dealing with import errors when trying to modify the tutorial codebase to suit my own purposes had me wanting to pull my hair out. \r\n\r\nI think tutorials are best when they start simple and add things in layers.  You could have started with the sub-optimal way to do things by statically declaring the Flask object and then added examples showing the factory pattern. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, the tutorial has kind of given be a bad taste for Flask, and I'm considering moving to Django. :(  \r\n\r\nEdit:  Maybe adding more info about how the application factory works would help?  One thing that confuses me after going through the tutorial is what is actually calling the factory?  How does it get created and used?",

      "body": "Based on discussion in #2023 and #641, Flask interferes too much with logging. This patch greatly reduces the logging configuration that Flask does.\r\n\r\n* Remove `LOGGER_NAME` and `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` configuration.\r\n* `app.logger` is always named `'flask.app'`. Use the `'flask'` namespace to allow other logging from Flask in the future.\r\n* Don't use a `Logger` subclass to override `getEffectiveLevel`. Call `setLevel` when the logger is first accessed, based on `app.debug`, instead of checking `debug` for every message.\r\n* Only one handler with one format is added, instead of different formats for production and development.\r\n* A handler is only added if there are no handlers configured that would handle the logger's `getEffectiveLevel`.\r\n* Handlers are never removed.\r\n* The `default_handler` is accessible so that it can be passed to `removeHandler` in case the user wants to get rid of the default handler after it is configured.\r\n* The proxy stream to `environ['wsgi.errors']` is exposed as `wsgi_errors_stream`, in case the user wants to use it in their own configuration.\r\n* Logging documentation is split from error handling documentation and reorganized to address the key concepts.\r\n* Added documentation for injecting request information into messages.\r\n* Logging tests are split into a separate module.\r\n* Some previously miscategorized tests are correctly organized.",

The user creates a request without Content-Length, flask gives it to me and then I pass it along to another server, which then returns HTTP 400 due to the bad Content-Length that werkzeug has inserted.  According to RFC 2616, Content-Length must be a number.\n\nInitially I thought this should be considered a werkzeug bug but maybe the empty string was intended to be werkzeug's signifier for a non-existent Content-Length, rather than an actual Content-Length value that could be used directly.  If that's the case, then I would modify flask so that Content-Length isn't included in the incoming request's headers if it is the empty string.\n\nBottom line, I believe that a client request that is missing a Content-Length header should not result in an incoming flask request with the Content-Length equal to the empty string.  \n",

Tests should fail without the change.\r\n- [ ] Add or update relevant docs, in the docs folder and in code.\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.rst` summarizing the change and linking to the issue.\r\n- [ ] Add `.. versionchanged::` entries in any relevant code docs.\r\n- [x] Run `pre-commit` hooks and fix any issues.\r\n- [x] Run `pytest` and `tox`, no tests failed.\r\n",

According to its typing interface, a TypedDict exposes fewer methods than a dict does, even though at runtime it's really just a dict. So from a typing perspective it makes sense to not allow a TypedDict to be accepted by a function that accepts a Dict. Otherwise, this would be valid:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass DefinitelyContainsStatus(TypedDict):\r\n    status: str\r\n\r\ndef delete_status(d: dict):\r\n    del d['status']\r\n\r\nd: DefinitelyContainsStatus = {'status': 'ok'}\r\ndelete_status(d)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you'd have a `DefinitelyContainsStatus` dict that doesn't contain `status`.\r\n\r\nFlask doesn't do anything of the sort; it doesn't modify the dict at all. So it should be able to accept dicts typed as TypedDict.\r\n\r\nHowever, you are right about the ambiguity. Perhaps the right approach is not to add `TypedDict` to `ResponseValue`, but instead to replace `Dict[str, Any]` with `Mapping[str, Any]`? That does accept TypedDicts.",

So that would solve the problem for 3.8 and later.\r\n\r\nHowever Python 3.7 still poses a problem, there's no TypedDict in the 3.7 standard library and I don't see a way to get it working with the one provided by typing_extensions.\r\n\r\nWould it be agreeable to add a version check, so that on 3.7 the current union is used and for 3.8+ `typing._TypedDict` is added? Similar version-dependent code exists for example in `src/flask/app.py` for `iscoroutinefunction`.",

          "body": "> Yes, given that the entire point of type checking is to describe the correct types and catch things before runtime. If they're not able to do that, that's a design issue that needs to be fixed with typing or type checkers.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I would suggest to revert #4579.\r\n\r\n> But with Mapping, it would accept invalid uses, so that doesn't seem \"strictly better\" just \"different for that specific use case\".\r\n\r\nBut in 2.1.2, literally every invalid type was accepted. Yes, being able to reject all invalid types before runtime is ideal, but not at the cost of also rejecting valid types.\r\n\r\nWith `Mapping`, all invalid non-Mapping types are still rejected, and non-dict Mapping types cause a very clearly written runtime error: `The view function did not return a valid response. The return type must be a string, dict, list, tuple with headers or status, Response instance, or WSGI callable, but it was a object.` which cannot be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nSurely that is still a significant improvement over 2.1.2.\r\n\r\nIn 2.1.3, where TypedDicts are not accepted, we would lose the ability to strongly type check our JSON-based API endpoints.",

I think the algorithm for `find_most_specific_for` would be too costly to implement at runtime, but also multiple inheritance would further complicate the behavior. I'm advocating a behavior where the order of registration determines which errorhandler gets called, which is IIRC what is currently implemented. So apart from removing special-casing for HTTP codes, nothing would change.\n",

Sorting by registration time passes that responsibility off to the user.\n\nwell, it still comes down to registration order when there are overrides and times. i just think that this behavior (in a \u201dnote\u201d box in the docs) is still more intuitive than e.g. following scenario:\n\n``` python\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n[...]\n\napp.errorhandler(403)\ndef default_forbidden():\n    return 'You\u2019re not allowed to do that', 403\n\n```\n\nand somewhere else\n\n``` python\n@app.errorhandler(CheatException)\ndef cheat(e):\n    return '''\n        You thought you\u2019d get through with faking your score\n        while it really is {e.real_score}\n    '''.format(e=e), CheatException.code\n\n@app.route('/submit_score/<score>')\ndef submit_score(score):\n    if not internal_score == score:\n        raise CheatException(internal_score)\n```\n\nNow add templates and more complexity and have fun debugging why you raised a CheatException for which you clearly just defined a handler (it\u2019s right there, for god\u2019s sake!) and still some nondescript 403 page came!\n\n> It does work for me (yes, with all the bugs), it doesn't with the bugs fixed.\n\nhuh? my pull request is incomplete and naive, made at a point where i thought the rest of the code worked as it seemed like it should, but it turns out that the tests rely on broken functionality, thus our discussion here. what do you actually use? what works? what doesn\u2019t? what fixed bugs are you talking about?\n",

Both projects have either deprecated or already removed such features. In general automatically generating anything users can interact with using a non-whitelist method is likely to cause information leakage, unauthorized writes and may provide a vector for DoS attacks.\n\nIf that isn't obvious to you (as you might have gathered it is, to several other people), you should educate yourself on basic security measures when writing software in general and web applications in particular. Reading about security issues (Django has excellent documentation on those) can also be very helpful.\n",

This \"security feature\" is only designed to warn web app developers that, if your users are running old IE, attack sites can read JSON responses that they shouldn't be able to read.  If you don't care about old IE users leaking data, possibly because your site explicitly disallows IE8 entirely, you can disable it.\n\nThe purpose of my patch is to make this protection more explicit and understandable, and not prevent other useful things.\n",

I'm of the opinion that we should _not_ change the default behavior of _Flask_ from what it is right now. So we should continue to raise an exception, if a list is passed to jsonify().\n\nThe fact that IE7 is outdated alone, may be sufficient reason for a developer to stop ensuring that a website looks as intended or is even usable in IE7. It's not a sufficient reason to not ensure that these users remain safe. Flask users can always override this decision but we should go with the conservative option for the framework itself.\n",

It seems impossible to get in contact with the creator. This PR removes the reference of `Flask-Uploads` from the docs. Another option would be to have a NOTE about it being abandoned. I think it also makes sense to remove it from the [Flask extensions list](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) (where's the repo for that?)\n\n[Here's a 2 year old ticket on Bitbucket that fixes Python 3 support](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/pull-request/5/modernizing/diff). No reply what-so-ever from @leafstorm. His last public activity on Bitbucket was three years ago.\n\nI'll e-mail him with a reference to this ticket to see if we can get a reply. Perhaps with this ticket we can get the project owner's attention.\n\nThe best alternative would of course be to get development going on the project again, perhaps by adding more contributors to the project. Let me know how you feel about all of this. :blush:\n",

I'm staying pretty busy with work, and my downtime is not usually the time I have an unread email from you in my inbox. :-P\n\nIf you create a GitHub fork and get everything ready for a release, send me an email or mention me on GitHub and I can give you release access on PyPI. I'll also sign off on a PR to the Flask Web site changing the Flask-Uploads entry to have your name as the maintainer - the file you'll need to change is https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-website/blob/master/flask_website/listings/extensions.py.\n\nBesides the PyPI admin rights and recognition as maintainer by @mitsuhiko, I don't think there's anything else I have that you would need in order to get set up. But let me know if anything I have control over is blocking you from taking over.\n\nAnd if anyone's interested in maintaining Flask-CouchDB, Flask-Login, Flask-Themes, or Flask-XML-RPC, the same offer applies.\n",

Once that's done, I'll migrate it over to Github, and then add a few niceties like Travis, fix python 3 compatibility, etc.\n\n@leafstorm can you give me admin access on the bitbucket repo? My bitbucket username is 'jeffwidman': https://bitbucket.com/leafstorm/flask-uploads/admin/access\n\nOnce I migrate to Github I will update the BB repo with links to the Github repo, similar to [the way pytest handled their migration](https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pytest/).\n",

Someone tried it on Python 3 and confirmed [it's working perfectly](stackoverflow.com/questions/33840765/flask-uploads-gives-attributeerror). \n\nI've also swapped from using Flask modules (which Flask deprecated quite a while ago) to operating as a normal Flask extension using blueprints. @mattupstate did a lot of the heavy lifting there in a [pull request back in 2013](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/pull-requests/5/modernizing) that just hadn't been merged in, and I tidied up a few last bits.\n\nAt this point, I think everything is ready for a new release to be cut, I'm just waiting on commit rights to Pypi. \n\nFor now, you can install directly from github using Pip: \n\n```\npip install git+https://git@github.com/jeffwidman/flask-uploads.git\n```\n",

          "body": "Thanks for the kind words. \n\nLast night I emailed @maxcountryman and @rduplain when I noticed they were collaborators on the Bitbucket repo, linking to this thread and asking if they wanted to be collaborators on the new repo. I was a bit surprised, as I had no idea anyone other than you were a collaborator until you gave me access to the BB repo. Ron said he was too busy, which is understandable. \n\nMax replied this morning basically saying thanks for the hard work but he had commit rights on PyPI and he isn't willing to transfer them. Instead since there was so much interest he was planning to migrate the project to his own github repo and suggested I contribute the fixes there.\n\nHe said he wished I'd tried to contact him sooner, which made no sense because multiple people have left comments on that bitbucket repo over the past few years asking if it was abandoned, with no reply. There was also that beautiful pull request from @mattupstate modernizing things that sat ignored. That's why we're even discussing this issue in the first place.\n\nI don't mind contributing to other people's projects, and I'm not trying to stir up drama here, but it does leave a bad taste in my mouth that I spent the better portion of a day fixing stuff up only to have a collaborator who's been absent from the project for years decide he's going to take control by strong arming PyPI rights. \n\nI'd be curious to hear Max expound on his thinking more here, maybe I'm just misunderstanding something. \n",

I still at least have PyPI ownership of the latter three.)\n\nI'd also like to hear @maxcountryman's plans for the project - since Jeff has already done the work of migrating it over to GitHub and merging a bunch of PR's, I don't think it makes sense to migrate from scratch to his account at this point.

      "body": "Hello all,\n\nI just upgraded to Werkzeug 0.10, after which I install watchdog to get the new inotify reloader working to help reduce CPU usage on my laptop. However, the reloader no longer works (or at am minimum is random in what it detects). \n\nTo start debugging, I tried to run the sample watchdog code on their homepage (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog) in an iPython shell and initially got an error. It related to not being able to allocate inotify watches due to a system constraint. After upping the limit (echo \"131072\" >> /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches), I was able to run the code in the shell.\n\nHowever, after that, the reloader still does not work. I am not sure what else I can do to help debug this, as watchdog seems to import correctly and my app does not throw any errors. Some diagnostic details:\n\n % lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\nVersions:\nWerkzeug==0.10.1\nwatchdog==0.8.3\nFlask==0.10.1\n\nPlease let me know if you need further information, I would be glad to debug.\n",

      "body": "Setting the `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_DEBUG` for every new terminal session is inconvenient. The CLI could load a `.env` file that contained these values instead. Since Heroku is a popular deployment option, this would also help developers who want the same scheme locally.\r\n\r\nInstead of writing our own parser, we should use [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv). This reduces maintenance burden on us and can be an optional dependency. If it is installed, the CLI will load the `.env`, otherwise it will skip it.\r\n\r\nPreviously discussed in #2164.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@miguelgrinberg raised a good point in the previous thread. `.env` is typically used to store sensitive configuration. The convenience of setting `FLASK_APP=` there could encourage users to commit the file publicly, which would be bad.\r\n\r\nA solution would be to load two files, `.flask-env` and `.env`, and prominently document that `.flask-env` can be committed but should not contain secrets.",

I'm also in favor of having Flask import a `.env` file, that is not supposed to be in source control. I think this would be a great addition regardless of the main point of this discussion.\r\n\r\nI think using a `.flaskenv` for the Flask env vars is a better idea than what we discussed in #2164. But I keep thinking that for people that use app factory functions now need to add two files: a `wsgi.py` that calls the factory function, and then this new `.flaskenv` that points to it.\r\n\r\nImplementing support for referencing a factory function in `FLASK_APP` is, in my opinion, not a great idea because the function might need custom arguments. So I see no way to avoid the need for a `wsgi.py` file.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the Flask CLI is perfectly happy to look for `app` or `application` in the module referenced by `FLASK_APP` if you don't give it a specific app name. So what if we also add sensible defaults for module name? For example, if `FLASK_APP` is not defined, we look for `wsgi.py` and `flaskapp.py` and use those. So then we have the following options:\r\n\r\n- `FLASK_APP` is not defined: look for `app` or `application` in `wsgi.py` or `flaskapp.py`.\r\n- `FLASK_APP=module.py`: look for `app` or `application` in`module.py`\r\n- `FLASK_APP=:myapp`: look for `myapp` in `wsgi.py` or `flaskapp.py`\r\n- `FLASK_APP=module.py:myapp`: look for `myapp` in `module.py`",

And it's a setting that you can also set via the Flask config object, or the `--debug` CLI option.\r\n\r\nThe reason I brought up the defaults for module names is that if we agree to implement them, then you have a way to not need to use `FLASK_APP`.\r\n\r\nRegarding the factory support for `FLASK_APP`, it looks pretty good, but it does not seem to cover all the possible cases. Basically I would need to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    FLASK_APP=app:create_app(os.getenv('FLASK_CONFIG') or 'default')\r\n\r\nThe `create_app` function is in the `app/__init__.py` module. I need to debug this, but Flask master fails to import `app` as given above, for some reason. If I move `create_app` to a top-level module then that part works, but the expression I need for the function's single argument does not seem to be accepted, the factory function gets `script_info` as this configuration argument.",

          "body": "Regarding quotes, looks like I did not do it above in my example, but for bash, the easiest is to enclose the whole thing in doble quotes, and only use single quotes for your literals. This is actually what I tried yesterday and failed to correctly copy here:\r\n\r\n    FLASK_APP=\"app:create_app(os.getenv('FLASK_CONFIG') or 'default')\"\r\n\r\nBut of course, this works in bash/zsh/etc only. I suspect you are going to have a lot more trouble to get something like this to work on Windows.\r\n\r\nYour suggested solution of letting the shell do the env var replacement should work, but again, it is a bash only solution.\r\n\r\nMoving this logic into the factory function, as you also suggested above, is not ideal. The default could be context based, so it is better handled by the caller. When you are running unit tests, for example, you will probably want the default configuration to be `'test'` instead of `'default'`. If you are starting a Celery worker for your app, for example, you'll probably want yet another configuration to be the default.\r\n\r\nI would personally not go through all these troubles to define `FLASK_APP`. Adding a `wsgi.py` file (which is already covered in the docs) is way more simple, and allows you to work in Python, regardless of the OS and shell that you use. So what I'm wondering is if we can agree that having a default for module name thus making `FLASK_APP` optional makes sense or not, maybe in addition to the .flaskenv effort which you seem to prefer.",

You obviously don't want to store `FLASK_DEBUG=1` in `.flaskenv` and then commit the file to source control.

It seems to me these features both solve the same problem (having different secrets on different environments). For example one could write multiple `.env` files (`.env.production`, `.env.staging`, `.env.development`), not checked in version control, and push the correct file on each environment using a configuration management tool.",

And will this open the door to people asking for other config options - do we then debate loading from redis or consul? The answer is hopefully no, but this does set the precedent for considering those if accepted.\r\n\r\nIf this is accepted as something we want, would a new method on the config object be more appropriate? Say one that accepted an env file and how to handle it?  ",

Could be useful in unit tests if all you care about is the context but don't want the actual template to be rendered for some reason.\n\nActually it is not so clear for me. Do you want to use this feature only for unit tests? Because I think this will look a little bit strange in the code.\n",

There are some forms with which this script would break:\n\n```\nfrom flask.ext.foo import \\\n    a, \\\n    b\n\nfrom flask.ext.foo import (\n    a,\n    b\n)\n```\n\nParsing definetly should be delegated to some third-party library. As said in #1135, https://github.com/python-modernize/python-modernize looks great, but I am not sure if one can easily extend it with own fixers.\n",

As you mentioned before, that would be quite tricky, maybe a warning is sufficient? I also added a few tests, but RedBaron needs to be installed on Travis in order to pass. Please comment on whether the tests are structured as expected for the project.\n\nLet me know how you want me to handle the above issue.\n",

I still need to fix another edge case, I will push that soon. Just a couple things I have questions about:\n1. How do I pip install RedBaron on the Travis build so I can pass the build?\n2. What is the correct way to import the script into my tester file? I'm just using: `sys.path.append('scripts')` right now, which works locally, but I don't think it will work when building on Travis.\n",

          "body": "@jrm2k6 This confuses me... earlier you said that beginner friendly issues don't need to be easy, but they should have a mentor assigned to them.\n\nSome thoughts:\n- It's really hard to determine the hardness of an issue without actually doing any research. This is why most of the work is intensive discussion and reading of RFCs (mostly in Werkzeug) or coming up with sensible (or rather, foolproof) APIs (mostly in Flask).\n- Mentoring is extremely time-consuming for both sides, but introducing such a formal process implies to me that there is somebody working full-time on Flask/Werkzeug, so i don't think mentoring is applicable in Flask's case, while it probably is in Mozilla's.\n- If you are interested in fixing an issue, i'd suggest to comment on it to see whether anybody else is currently doing anything related, otherwise you may ask where to start. I can't really see how in Flask's case, a mentoring process would give you quicker response times than this strategy.\n- One bug that doesn't require deep knowledge of Flask's or Werkzeug's internals, but still is a lot of work would be https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/issues/1135 -- there we'd have to write a tool that automatically fixes the codebase of a Flask user, given that `flask.ext` is going to be deprecated.\n- Anything with the 1.0 milestone (and as mentioned, any doc issues) are worthwhile fixing in the near future.\n",

          "body": "I'd like to see a *strong* recommendation for people to set all these security headers on the webserver (or, if present, loadbalancer) level. Most of them don't really belong into the app itself (except maybe X-Frame-Options when framing should be allowed in some case and CORS headers since setting these globally is rarely a good idea if you aren't doing an API)\r\n\r\nflask-secure-headers looks rather inactive (last commit 2015) and uses very poor coding practices (`from headers import *` - not only a wildcard import but also an implicit relative import that would most likely not work in PYthon 3) so I'd not even mention it.\r\n\r\nI'd focus on mentioning a single extension (flask-talisman looks quite good and, according to their repo's org name, seems to be developed by google) and not repeat the link to them but mention that this extension can handle all these headers if someone prefers to do it on the application level.",
