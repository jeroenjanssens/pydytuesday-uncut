          "body": "@scorphus thanks for your feedback! I believe that this rule would be worthwhile as I encountered it enough times to choose to spend my time on creating a rule for it. I tutor a computer science class where we teach git and have observed that I'm far from the only person to make this mistake. Since there's a rule for handling `git clone git clone`, which is useful when I type `git clone` then paste the URL, only for it to include its own `git clone` (Bitbucket does this), I'd say that this particular rule is reasonable enough, since it handles the opposite case.\r\n\r\nRE: your feedback on output matching, it does seem to be a little pointless. If you're interested in merging this PR at some point then I'll absolutely get rid of it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it could search for `'git'` within the URL as an additional measure to avoid false positives? This would still work for all most of the popular git servers I'm aware of, at least using SSH. Would that change make the addition be worthwhile? Can you think of any other methods I could use to reduce the number of false positives?",

I fixed up things as per your suggestion, and also removed the code that checked the output.\r\n\r\nDouble checking, since I'm not entirely sure, should it check the URL for the presence of `git` somewhere? The only case I can think of that wouldn't work would be cloning using HTTPS on Bitbucket where `.git` has been manually removed from the end of their copied URL. Their SSH username is `git`, and their copy clone button copies the `git clone` part anyway. It would be helpful for preventing false positives such as [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (I apologise in advance).\r\n\r\n",

Also, all EXYZ-related commits could be joined together, leaving one single commit per violation \u2013\u00a0E123, E225, E231, E265, E302, E402, E711 and E731.\n\nWhat do you think about getting a cleaner history?\n",

Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`\n==> default: to force provisioning.

See 'git --help'.`\r\n`The most similar command is`\r\n`        status`\r\n`my_user@my_machine:/some/non-git/directory$ time fuck`\r\n`git status [enter/\u2191/\u2193/ctrl+c]`\r\n`fatal: not a git repository`\r\n`real    XmX.XXs`\r\n`user    XmX.XXs`\r\n`sys     XmX.XXs`\r\n\r\nThe average of the user times was: 0.336\r\nThe average of the sys times was: 1.7954\r\nWe don't care about the real time since that includes I/O. To better understand the output of `time`, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/556405/what-do-real-user-and-sys-mean-in-the-output-of-time1/556411#556411)\r\n\r\nAfter removing the appended Windows path as @kimlym suggested [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1640#issuecomment-616887435) , running `$ echo $PATH` now only returns 11 entries.\r\nRepeating the same sequence of tests:\r\nThe average of the user times was: 0.2032\r\nThe average of the sys times was: 0.2157\r\n\r\nThis represents a 40% reduction in user time, and a 88% reduction in sys time.\r\nSo it does seem like shortening the PATH does help `thefuck` run faster.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be desirable for `thefuck` to run quickly with a longer PATH... Maybe investigating into why there is such a large increase in sys time for a longer PATH would lead to something promising?",

So something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    return [' '.join(shell.quote(a) for a in [new_command] + command.script_parts[1:])\r\n            for new_command in new_cmds]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere quote is obtained from the current shell (`from thefuck.shells import shell`).

You see, it works when you [run `thefuck` manually](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/issues/549#issuecomment-324243535). Let's try and identify where the problem might be. It may be a daunting process, so please bear with me. What are the outputs of the following two commands:\r\n\r\n- `type fuck`\r\n- `functions fuck`\r\n",

There are a few people commenting on issues and PRs that it seems like people would be willing to help out, but nothing has really been done.\r\n\r\nAs of writing, @nvbn has disappeared (see https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/pull/1415#issuecomment-2091471140), there are 260 open issues out of 730 total issues (with 470 closed issues) and 86 open pull requests out of 695 total.\r\n\r\nThe most recent commit was c7e7e1d, which constituted fixing readme typos and 62e0767, the commit before that, is well over a year old now. It seems like @scorphus is the most recent active maintainer, however given the time since the last merged PR and hasn't commented on any issues or PRs since. His github activity shows he was still around doing *something* pretty consistently up until a bit over a week ago, but hasn't done anything related to this project since the PR in January.\r\n\r\nIn #1415, there is some discussion about a maintainer (presumably @scorphus) fixing the issue and not merging the PR, however that was well after the second last commit to main, so I'm unsure what exactly is going on there. It's possibly a misunderstanding, as the latest release is from January 2022, which means somewhere around two and a half years of commits until 62e0767, none of which have been released.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of a maintained fork, please mention it here. If not, I might consider putting myself up for the task of maintaining the project, but ideally it would be a part of the original repo here instead of a fork. If anyone else would like to maintain the project, please volunteer yourself as I'm not entirely sold on the idea of maintaining this myself but I would like to see this project get some of the love, bugfixes and updates it deserves.",

          "body": "@jdtogni78 That sounds like a great idea. I myself personally prefer hard and fast rules, as it's more predictable. If I write a rule for, say, running a command with sudo, I know exactly when it's going to trigger and exactly what the output is.\n\nThis isn't to say there isn't a place for LLMs, I just prefer something more predictable. I think there have been a couple issues here with requests for AI integration and maybe even a PR, although I don't have them on hand.\n\nWhile you say you don't want to own the repo, I do think it's a good idea and if you want to do it, you should just start writing the code now. My advice is to not feel pressured to maintain a repo and instead just do what you feel like. If your repo gains enough traction, there will be people willing to take on maintenance.\n\nI myself don't have any experience working with AI integration code, so I don't think I can commit to something like what you're describing either, but maybe sometime in the future? Either way, I'd encourage you to just start writing code now and worry about other people later. OSS is inherently unselfish, and you as a developer have absolutely no obligation (be it moral or otherwise) to do what anyone else says or expects.\n\nTo use thefuck as an example, @nvbn hasn't been seen in a long time. I find it a shame that such an excellent repo has pretty much died out, but there's nothing I can really do about it. I don't blame nvbn either, I'm thankful that he made the project in the first place. If you want to write your own tool, go ahead. By writing OSS code, you aren't promising anything other than the legal rights to use and modify the stuff you wrote, meaning you can just up and leave like nvbn and people will (or should anyway) be thankful for the work you've already put in.\n\nThis is really all just to say \"start writing the code now and everything else can come later\".",

So, with some *really* janky trickery, I was able to make thefuck work on Windows with Cmder.\r\n\r\n1. Run `clink set history_io 1` and restart your shell. By default clink only writes history on exit, this ensures it writes as commands are run.\r\n2. Place this file somewhere in your path: https://gist.github.com/OfficerHalf/a9848df0a25706532f86dc8aaae56e4f\r\n3. Run `alias fuck=thefuckcmder`\r\n\r\nIf you only want to use clink, not Cmder, you can replace all the `%CMDER_ROOT%` paths with `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\clink\\.history`\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a better way to do this, I'm just not sure what it is. `ctrl+c` also crashes the whole thing, and colors in the console seem to get funky.\r\n\r\nEssentially that batch file:\r\n1. Writes the last command run (before `fuck`) to a temporary file by getting the 2nd to last line of the history file.\r\n2. Sets `fucked_cmd` to the content of that file\r\n3. Runs `thefuck %fucked_cmd%`, and saves the output to a second temporary file, this time a `.cmd` file.\r\n4. Calls that `.cmd` file\r\n\r\nI don't do a whole lot of batch stuff, so if someone can condense that, be my guest.",

          "body": "I've been using a custom rule that supports the new [unified CLI](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix#unified-cli) for a while, and was planning on opening a PR once this one has been merged (I hesitate to update this current PR as it's already tested and ready to be merged). I don't know if that will happen soon, so in the meantime I've pushed the changes to [this](https://github.com/thenbe/thefuck/tree/nix-shell-new) new branch instead, which [builds](https://github.com/thenbe/thefuck/compare/nix-shell...thenbe:thefuck:nix-shell-new) on this here PR. You can use the updated rule by adding it as a [custom rule](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-your-own-rules) to your config.\r\n\r\nIn the new rule, three variants are suggested. Assuming I run `cowsay hello world`, I am presented with the following:\r\n\r\n1. `nix run nixpkgs#cowsay -- hello world`: This runs my command in a non-interactive shell. Uses the nix unified CLI.\r\n1. `nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay`: This enters an interactive shell with `cowsay` available, but does not run any command. This is useful if you'd rather run the command yourself after entering the shell because your command requires delicate massaging (e.g. running it with `sudo`, prefixing it with environment variable, juggling quote variants, etc).\r\n1. `nix-shell -p cowsay --run \"cowsay hello world\"`. This runs my command in a non-interactive shell. Uses the nix original CLI.\r\n1. `nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay --command cowsay hello world`: Very similar to the first one so I've personally disabled this one.\r\n\r\n### Thoughts on future updates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- It'd be nice if there was a variant that runs my command and then _keeps me_ in the shell.\r\n  - For the original CLI, we [can](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.19/command-ref/nix-shell#options) add a `--command \"echo hello; return\"` to our `nix-shell` invocation.\r\n  - For the unified CLI: not sure yet, we might need to do something like this example from the [docs](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.19/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-shell): ` nix shell nixpkgs#gnumake --command sh -c \"cd src && make\"`\r\n- We should expose a couple of flags for users to configure this.\r\n  - `disable_unified_cli` (boolean)\r\n  - `disable_original_cli` (boolean)\r\n- As far as I can tell, the `command-not-found` db doesn't really play nice if you use flakes to configure your system and might return stale results (unless you update it manually?). [`nix-index`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-index) seems to be the go-to alternative. It'd be great if we could optionally use that instead (perhaps behind a flag `enable_nix_index` for users who have installed `nix-index` (`programs.nix-index.enable = true;` in home manager).",

      "body": "Hello! I'm a day late for Hacktoberfest but I hope you find this PR useful.\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to fix #959 and add better integration with the [composer](https://getcomposer.org) tool. It turns out the issue of the crash was not because \"there was only one suggestion\" as suggested in the Issue, but rather that the matcher erroneously matches __package not found__ errors instead of just __command not found__ errors. Since the output of the two varies significantly, I have created two separate rules (and tests) for this functionality.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the old tests used outdated test cases from more than 2 years ago (the output has changed in newer versions). I have tested it on newer versions of composer, notably the latest version of composer (`1.7.0`).\r\n\r\n##### Behaviour of issue #959 before fix:\r\n![composer single package old](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SlimOffbeatBonobo-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### After fix:\r\n![composer single package new](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ScaryForsakenLemur-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\nThe original `composer-not-command` was also not comprehensive enough: when multiple suggestions are offered, only one is passed to `thefuck`. This is fixed:\r\n\r\n##### Before\r\n![composer not command multiple old](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MisguidedForcefulAfghanhound-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### After\r\n![composer not command multiple new](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EachDependentBittern-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n(the stray `composer require potato` appears to be a framework issue outside my domain, as my unit tests that tests the suggested commands pass)\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the `composer-not-package` rule, `thefuck` is now alot more accommodating of various user mistakes:\r\n\r\n#### Attempting to `require` an erronous package name with multiple suggestions lets `thefuck` cycle through all suggestions\r\n\r\n##### Before\r\n![composer many package old](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PossibleSpryFreshwatereel-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### After\r\n![composer many package new](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CarefulMindlessAfricanbushviper-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n#### `thefuck` now also respects version constraints, as reflected in the generated suggestions:\r\n\r\n##### Single suggestion + version constraint\r\n![composer single package version constraint](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DescriptiveCourteousBeardedcollie-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### Multiple suggestions + version constraint\r\n![composer multiple package version constraint](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/TiredWaterloggedFunnelweaverspider-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Finally, `thefuck` is able to do consecutive `fuck`s with `composer`, such as in the case where the user attempts to `require` several erroneous package names at once:\r\n\r\n![composer consecutive fucks](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/NecessaryWellgroomedAbyssiniancat-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n### Tests & Documentation\r\n\r\nI have revamped the tests with updated output from recent versions of composer. It looks messy but it contains all the different possible scenarios that can result from botched user input. I have tried my best with making the code self documenting with sensible variable names and comments.\r\n\r\n`flake8` does not produce any visible warnings. All tests pass except `test_go_unknown_command.py`, but that test also fails on a fresh clone of the upstream repository so I guess it's not related to my commits.",

Things such as formatting that should be part of a different PR \u2013\u00a0I know it was in the middle of one or two of my suggestions, I didn't notice it back then, sorry for that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've just noticed that this PR fixes a rule and introduces another. These should be at least two separate commits.\r\n\r\nDo you think you can split the changes in separate commits, undo the lines that are not part of the fix/feature and update this PR? Otherwise, I could do that, if you don't mind. Authorship would be maintained, of course.",

On one hand, Black is great because it leaves no space for discussions about how to format code \u2013 it does it for you. Out of a sudden, you stop wasting time with everything related to code formatting. On the other hand, when it comes to a codebase that's not previously formatted by it, that may generate undesirable noise, such as some parts of this pull request. So it's up to the developer to include only the relevant changes.\r\n\r\nPlease LMK if I can make myself any clearer. (I often fail at that)\r\n\r\nThanks again for contributing and for sticking to it!",

Would making that assumption more generic (i.e. convert all arguments starting with `0` to `-`) make sense?\r\n\r\nFor that matter, what would the \"undo\" action look like, or would there even need to be an \"undo\" action? (In the specific example here, I need to delete a branch that was just accidentally created...what should the proper response be if `git branch 0v` wasn't the command?",

A considerable number of users have the function hardcoded either in their `config.fish` or in some `functions/fuck.fish`. I've seen a lot of cases like that. Even some issues have that as a suggestion to improve the loading time of the shell.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that it does not support a new feature I'm bringing together, which is the \u201cedit command.\u201d For that, I'd like to avoid having the `commandline` instruction added to the history.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think the `commandline` part of this PR should be moved into `shell`. I already have a working CL, which I'll submit shortly afterward as a new commit on top of yours. Then, you can review it.\r\n\r\nSounds good?",

Then we can leave `--alias` functionality untouched. What do you think?\n",

What is the point of using Python 2 if Python 3 is available? Is there anything in The Fuck that is not compatible with Python 3? Is there any platform where Python 2 is available, but Python 3 is not?\nPython 3 just works. I don't think Python 2 should be a time consuming problem in 2015.\nI vote for updating the install script to use Python 3 and advise using it on the README.\n\n(I think that most people just use Python 2 when Python 3 would be perfectly fine is because `/usr/bin/python` defaults to Python 2 on most platforms, and `python` 1 character less than `python3`).\n",

Can you please place the following in your `config.fish`?\n\n```\nset -x TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES 'cd,grep,ls,man,open,git'\n```\n\nAlthough this should be enough to fix this issue, I think TheFuck could be improved in order to append those aliases to the _default_ ones. IOW, that line should include only `git`. Also, a README and/or Wiki entry explaining this.\n",

Fish Shell itself overrides some commands that TheFuck has rules for, namely: `cd`, `grep`, `ls`, `man` and `open`. That's why we have the [default overridden aliases](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/blob/95e7d00aec1ea1eb850c3d3b376ebfb792edcf63/thefuck/shells/fish.py#L12).\n",

Rather, it allows regulation of speech only if there are objective indications of harm, such as threats, fraud or violence. The court protects offensive speech because speech on matters of public concern is valuable even when it is delivered in an offensive manner and because punishing offensive speech can lead to censorship of unpopular views. In doing so, the court has implicitly recognized the inherent tensions created by our psychological responses to offensive speech and the importance we place on the free exchange of ideas.\"\n\nhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/jn.aspx\n",

We are close to resolving that too.\r\n\r\n@scorphus, this still won't work. Since you are using nix file path on windows installation of python (which understands windows paths like `C:\\tmp` and not `/c/tmp`).\r\nAn elegant solution is using `$HOME` environment variable. In both git bash and python, it points to the same directory, plus it is in the proper format (`C:\\Users\\<username>` in python(windows) and `/c/Users/<username>` in git bash).\r\n\r\nEdit: I tried using the $HOME env variable and got it working for me.\r\n![Git Bash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62170586/82656772-e8c12200-9c41-11ea-9387-ad09bbc4b13a.JPG)\r\n",

And that should be a specific file, always the same\u2014not a temp one\u2014being overwritten every time. I\u2019m not super fond of this solution. But, it seems like we\u2019re going to have to opt for it. \n\nBefore we do so... Like @grrrrinaldi, I got it working just fine. Works for me with Git for Windows 2.26.2 on a VM with Windows 10. 2.26.2 was installed with default options (no installation option changed.)\n\n@grrrrinaldi, do you confirm the last commit referenced above works? Just to make sure as it is not yet released. Also, would you be willing to test yet another alternative, HOME/XDG based solution? Thanks in advance. ",

          "body": "I managed to get it working just now and thought i'd share my findings:\r\nI'm on windows using scoop as my package manager. I had some issues when installing thefuck using scoop, but i think after a restart it seemed to start working. For anyone wondering, i install thefuck from anderlli0053's scoop bucket called DEV-tools.\r\nScoop was managing my python installation which is on a version where the `imp` module has been dropped in favor of `importlib`. All i had to do was change some of the source code. Where the command was showing an error there was a usage of the `load_source` function imported from `imp`. I replaced with my own defenition:\r\n```py\r\nimport importlib.util\r\nimport importlib.machinery\r\n\r\ndef load_source(modname, filename):\r\n    loader = importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader(modname, filename)\r\n    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(modname, filename, loader=loader)\r\n    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\r\n    # The module is always executed and not cached in sys.modules.\r\n    # Uncomment the following line to cache the module.\r\n    # sys.modules[module.__name__] = module\r\n    loader.exec_module(module)\r\n    return module\r\n```\r\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76694726/replacing-imp-load-source-in-python-3-12\r\nI did this in two places, but i'm not sure if its necessary. It errored once when i called `fuck` and again when i called `thefuck` from the command line so i just replaced both to be safe.\r\nAfter that all i had to do was paste in the `alias`.\r\n\r\nFor me an `alias` doesn't support expressions or something like that so i made it a `def` instead. Here it is:\r\n```nu\r\ndef fuck [\r\n    --yes(-y),\r\n    --yeah,\r\n    --hard,\r\n    --repeat(-r),\r\n    --debug(-d)\r\n    --enable-experimental-instant-mode,\r\n    --shell-logger(-l)\r\n    --help(-h),\r\n    --version(-v),\r\n] {\r\n    if $help { thefuck -h; return }\r\n    if $version { thefuck -v; return }\r\n\r\n    mut options = []\r\n\r\n    if $yes or $yeah or $hard { $options = ($options | append \"-y\") }\r\n    if $repeat { $options = ($options | append \"-r\") }\r\n    if $debug { $options = ($options | append \"-d\") }\r\n    if $enable_experimental_instant_mode { $options = ($options | append \"--enable-experimental-instant-mode\") }\r\n    if $shell_logger { $options = ($options | append \"-l\") }\r\n\r\n    let options = ($options | str join \" \")\r\n    let hist = (history | last 1) | get command.0\r\n    let fuck = $\"(TF_ALIAS=fuck PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 thefuck $options $hist)\"\r\n    nu -e $\"($fuck | str replace -a \"\\r\" \"\" | str replace -a \"\\n\" \"\")\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIts a lot more code i admit, bit the other examples didn't work for me so here we are :D\r\nHere i'm running `nu` with the `-e` flag and just passing the command as a string. This way if you do a command such as `cd` it still works. Without the `-e` flag, nu runs the command in a seperate process and forgets about it. With `-e` it runs it in a seperate process and then changes the current one to that new process kinda...\r\n\r\nThis also avoid saving to a temp file :D.\r\n\r\nI tested several things here. One thing to note is the `--shell-logger` flag can be removed if using windows since it only works on Linux or Mac, but i included it here anyway.\r\nTested with multi-line commands, seems to work fine actually, although `thefuck` doesn't know about the internal nu commands making it worse than it needs to be. I ran\r\n```nu\r\nloop {\r\n    print hello\r\n    sleep 1sec\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand it changed it to\r\n```nu\r\nscoop {\r\n    print hello\r\n    sleep 1sec\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich makes sense. `scoop` is an executable in my PATH, but the nu commands arent, so it doesn't know about them and thus, doesn't use them for fixing commands.\r\nHope this helps someone who just want to hack this together like i did :D",

I've included your suggestions and rebased on latest `master`\r\n\r\nHowever, I notice that the automated checks are failing on python 2.7 at what looks to be the install stage. I'm not sure how the changes made would have caused this and have just tested installing on 2.7.17 locally and it seemed to work fine (unit and functional tests pass locally on 2.7.17, too). If you have any pointers for investigating further that would be greatly appreciated!",

Anyway, I didn't investigate too much into that issue. Instead came up with #1187 that forces `decorator<5` for Python <= 2.7. Once 3.31 is released, this and other makeshifts will be removed.\r\n\r\nI'll get #1187 merged soon. Then you're free to rebase on top of master again. Thanks in advance!",

When I removed that the order of the rules must have been affected. \n\n**To simplify what I am thinking:**\nSuppose the rules are taken one at a time in an alphabetical fashion. Since 'a' comes before 's', apt-get.py will be evaluated before sl_ls.py. This means 'sl' never reaches sl_ls.py since apt-get was found first and since the first rule is satisfied it does not go any further.\n\nWhat pranav says is right but only partially. The stderr is only used in some cases to find a match. For example in sl_ls.py the script directly uses the command rather than stderr.\n\n**Does it always correct you?** Depends on whether it finds a match or not. If it does, it will. If it does not, then it 'Won't give a fuck'. \n\n**Logic:**\n1. In the 'sl' joke version, the problem is no error is generated, so there is no rule that is satisfied, hence 'no fuck'\n2. In my apt-get version, the apt-get rule is satisfied because of the stderr, hence it tries to install.\n3. If we randomise the order of the rules, like I tried, chances are that the first rule to be satisfied is sl_ls, therefore, it gives ls.\n",
