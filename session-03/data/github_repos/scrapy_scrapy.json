Given the fact that all fields are supposed to be provided (except for those with default values, or unless a custom constuctor is provided) and that loaders try to _append_ values, I think only dataclasses defined as the following would work:\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\r\nfrom scrapy.loader import ItemLoader\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass InventoryItem:\r\n    name: list = field(default_factory=list)\r\n    price: list = field(default_factory=list)\r\n    stock: list = field(default_factory=list)\r\n\r\nlo = ItemLoader(item=InventoryItem())\r\nlo.add_value('name', 'foo bar')\r\nprint(lo.load_item())  # prints \"InventoryItem(name=['foo bar'], price=[], stock=[])\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your feedback!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] Scraper class changes\r\n- [x] Exporters support\r\n- [x] Item loader support\r\n- [x] Parse command\r\n- [x] Shell command\r\n- [x] Contracts\r\n- [x] Docs\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n\r\nThis patch works with the built-in [`dataclassess` module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/dataclasses.html) in Python 3.7+, and with the [`dataclassess` backport](https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses/) in Python 3.6.\r\n\r\n**Update 2**\r\nChecklist for the new implementation based on the `ItemAdapter` class\r\n- [x] ItemAdapter class\r\n- [x] Refactor existing components to use ItemAdapter class\r\n- [x] ItemAdapter tests\r\n- [x] docs (WIP)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Update 3:**\r\nSupporting [`python-attrs`](https://www.attrs.org) now too.

The same applies to item_scraped, item_dropped, item_error signal handlers, and to item pipelines.\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, most item pipelines will need to be changed. For example, does FilesPipeline work with dataclasses?\r\n\r\nIt is a bit trickier than with dict vs Item, because dicts and Items both support `item[\"field\"]` access, while dataclasses don't, so some code which worked with items and dicts without any explicit checks will stop working for dataclasses.\r\n\r\nCheck e.g. pipeline examples at https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#topics-item-pipeline: they should work for items and dicts, but they won't work for dataclasses. We need to make it consistent.\r\n\r\nAs a minimum, I think we need to \r\n\r\n1. Document how to make your components ready for dataclasses.\r\n2. After documenting (looking at all steps required), try to simplify it, if possible.",

I added a decorator to allow dictionary-like access to dataclass objects, a FAQ entry about it and some notes in the signals, pipelines and spider middleware pages; let me know what you think about this approach.\r\nI had some problems with the code sample in the docs, [`sybil.parsers.skip.skip`](https://sybil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parsers.html#skip) does not seem to be working correctly at 5a97a38 (I also tried with `.. skip: start` and `.. skip: end`, to no avail). I ended up ignoring the `docs/faq.rst`, but I'm not a fan of this, please let me know if you know a way to solve it (cc @Gallaecio, the original author of the Sybil integration).",

Remaining concerns: \r\n\r\n* users can't really use dataclasses as items, because of the existing middlewares, item pipelines, etc. What we really support is `@subscriptable_dataclass`. I think that's a good idea to have something like that, to make items more compatible with existing pipelines, but it may be not enough. \r\n*  ^^ applies even for built-in components - e.g. FilesPipeline doesn't support dataclasses.\r\n* We don't explain how to write middlewares which support dataclasses directly, and don't provide any helpers for that.

          "body": "Hey @kmike, thanks for the feedback :smile:\r\n\r\nOne thing I'd like to discuss about the `subscriptable_dataclass` thing: I'd prefer to take the burden of making dataclass items Scrapy-ready away from the user as much as possible, i.e. not _requiring_ them to decorate items in order for built-in components to work properly. With that in mind, the media pipelines \"natively\" handle dataclass items now (tests updated). This is done by converting `\u00ectem`s to `dict`s if necessary in their item processing methods, in order to populate such items with the URLs to be downloaded (without doing something [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52536584), kinda hackish IMHO). The implication is that the output of those methods is not of the same type as the input.\r\n\r\nRegarding spider middlewares, I added a note to the `process_spider_output` method docs pointing to the FAQ entry about dataclass items, which explains the implementation and mentions the `subscriptable_dataclass` decorator, I believe that should be enough.\r\n\r\nI checked built-in components such as extensions, pipelines and middlewares, I think nothing else needs updating at this point but another pair of eyes checking this fact are always welcome. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing your comments, thanks again!",

For instance, in my perfect world I would love to use not vanilla dataclasses, but [pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/)'s version of the annotation, so that I can offload even validation to the item definition. Having a conflicting decorator in `scrapy` would make that probably much harder.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

Could you review it? =)\r\nI added some tests to be confident that this functionality works well with all formats.\r\nI also added documentation.\r\n\r\nI created a new class `PartialDeliveriesTest`. Some functions that it needed were in `FeedExportTest` so I also created `FeedExportTestBase` and moved such functions there. \r\n`__test__ = False` - helps not to execute tests inside `FeedExportTestBase`;\r\nPartialDeliveriesTest has almost the same tests as in FeedExportTest class:\r\n`test_export_items`\r\n`test_export_no_items_not_store_empty`\r\n`test_export_no_items_store_empty`\r\n`test_export_multiple_configs`\r\nBut also there are some which check only partial deliveries functionality:\r\n`test_wrong_path`\r\n`test_batch_path_differ`\r\n\r\n- Here should be tests like `S3FeedStorageTest` but I tried not to skip `test_store` in `S3FeedStorageTest` and got an exception that `spider` has not attribute `crawler` in `BlockingFeedStorage` class.\r\n- Can removing `replace(microsecond=0)` from `params['time'] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat().replace(':', '-')` break someone's pipelines? So it might be better to use for example `time_id` instead of just `time`.",

We could have a different field order, number of whitespaces, number of new lines.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the best option would be to create a new method called `assertEqualJSON` or something like that, which actually parses the JSON content into a dictionary and uses Python's built-in comparison to assert that the content of the two JSON strings is equivalent.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense?",

      "body": "As per the discussion with @elacuesta and @Gallaecio. This PR will integrate [xtractmime](https://github.com/scrapy/xtractmime) library into Scrapy for MIME sniffing\r\n\r\nFixes #2900, fixes #4240.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\nBehavior:\r\n\r\n- An empty body with no indication of a type through headers or file extensions now maps to `TextResponse` instead of to `Response`.\r\n- A response with `Content-Encoding` is now always `Response` (until uncompressed, when the header is removed and the response class mapping re-evaluated). `Content-Disposition`, URL, and body can no longer result in a different response class.\r\n- The file extension is no longer taken into account for HTTP requests, only for the file system and for FTP requests.\r\n  - An exception *not contemplated in the MIME sniffing standard* is made for the `Content-Disposition` header: as long as `Content-Type` is not defined or has a value equivalent to not being defined (e.g. `*/*`), `Content-Disposition` is taken into account, i.e. the MIME type matching the file extension is considered the supplied MIME type, as if it had been defined in the `Content-Type` header. This is because in Scrapy we treat those responses the same as other responses (i.e. we do not download them in file pipelines automatically, we handle them in callbacks just like regular responses), so it seems appropriate to consider the server-suggested file extension to determine the right response class.\r\n- The supplied MIME type (i.e. Content-Type in HTTP or based on file extension in filesystem or FTP) now takes priority over body sniffing even if it maps to `Response` where the body would map to something like `TextResponse`.\r\n  Before, the first things in the (headers, url, filename, body) that would map to something other than `Response` would dictate the selected class. So, for example, if the header or URL indicated a binary response but the body was plain text, the result was `TextResponse`.\r\n  - An exception is made for supplied plain-text MIME types related to an Apache bug, for which the body is inspected in case the response is binary, and if it is `Response` is used instead of `TextResponse`.\r\n  - Another exception is made for `text/html`, for which the body is inspected in case it is actually a news feed file, and if so `XmlResponse` is used.\r\n- Response class mapping based on the supplied MIME type has been changed as follows:\r\n  - `application/xhtml+xml` and `application/vnd.wap.xhtml+xml` now map to `XmlResponse` instead of to `HtmlResponse`. See \u201cNote that XHTML is best parsed as XML\u201d @ https://lxml.de/parsing.html\r\n  - `application/ecmascript` and `application/x-ecmascript` now map to `TextResponse` instead of `Response`.\r\n  - MIME types ending in `+json` (e.g. `application/foo+json`, `application/ld+json`) now always map to `TextResponse`.\r\n  - MIME types ending in `+xml` (e.g. `application/foo+xml`) now always map to `TextResponse`.\r\n  - The following MIME types *not contemplated in the MIME sniffing standard* have been kept, mapped to `JsonResponse` or `TextResponse`, as keeping them seems harmless: `application/x-json`, `application/json-amazonui-streaming`, `application/x-javascript`. However, we may want to consider removing support for them to be more in line with the standard, since `TextResponse` should get selected anyway based on the body.\r\n- Note that the end result for the new mappings above that used to point to `Response` or that did not exist at all, the actual response class used will generally not have changed, because for old `Response` mappings body-based detection used to always run, in case the body content could suggest other than `Response`. The advantage now is that we skip body-based detection altogether for those new mappings.\r\n- The body is now only taken into account when there is no supplied MIME type otherwise, or in the 2 exceptions mentioned above (Apache bug and mislabeled feeds).\r\n- Body-based detection has improved for corner cases, including:\r\n  - `\\0` is now considered binary. `\\x0c` and `\\x1b` are no longer considered binary.\r\n  - Many more corner cases where HTML is now detected.\r\n  - Many cases where binary files are now detected as such based on their file signature where before they could be misinterpreted as text if they happened not to have any binary bytes.\r\n- Body-based detection now inspects the first 1445 bytes, not the first 5000.\r\n- For data URIs, in addition to the declared MIME type, the body is now also taken into account.\r\n- When faced with a multi-encoded response (e.g. `Content-Encoding: br, gzip`) the HTTP compression middleware now applies all decoding, instead of applying only the last one.\r\n  This is an *unrelated* change that I (@Gallaecio) deemed worth applying when I realized the issue when working on relevant changes. We could move it into its own pull request, though, if desired.\r\n\r\nAPI:\r\n- The `scrapy.responsetypes` module is deprecated in favor of the new `scrapy.utils.response.get_response_class` function\r\n- The `scrapy.utils.response.get_base_url` function is deprecated in favor of the new `TextResponse.base_url` property\r\n  I do not recall the reason behind this change, it *seems unrelated* to this pull request, so we could move it into its own pull request if desired.\r\n\r\n# Not implemented\r\n\r\n- No option to disable sniffing (i.e. body-based type detection for scriptable content) has been implemented:\r\n  - The option to disable sniffing on the Scrapy side is not implemented. It could be implemented in the future through a setting.\r\n  - `X-Content-Type-Options` from a web server is not taken into account. We could implement it in the future. Note that it is not part of the MIME sniffing standard itself, but the result of its handling can be fed into the MIME sniffing standard algorithm, which accepts a nosniff flag.\r\n- The MIME sniffing standard allows for the extension of body-based detection rules, as long as those additional rules are not for MIME types with rules already defined in the standard. We could eventually expose this through a setting, to let Scrapy users define their own rules. Or we could expose custom rules, e.g. using a magic-based library. However, since the MIME types for which we have specific classes are already covered, I do not expect much demand for such a feature at the moment.\r\n\r\n# To-do\r\n\r\n- [x] Upgrade the minimum version of xtractmime\r\n  - [x] Release a new version of [xtractmime](https://github.com/scrapy/xtractmime) with https://github.com/scrapy/xtractmime/pull/14\r\n  - [x] Update `setup.py` and `tox.ini` here accordingly.",

In fact, maybe you could stop relying on `CLASSES` altogether and instead expose some methods based on https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#mime-type-groups in xtractmime and use them here, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmime_type = extract_mime(\u2026)\r\nif is_html_mime_type(mime_type):\r\n    return HtmlResponse\r\nif is_xml_mime_type(mime_type):\r\n    return XmlResponse\r\nif (\r\n    mime_type.startswith('text')\r\n    or is_json_mime_type(mime_type)\r\n    or is_javascript_mime_type(mime_type)\r\n):\r\n    return TextResponse\r\nreturn Response\r\n```",

I meant that, at some point in the future, users may ask to be able to send a custom value for this parameter to xtractmime, overriding whatever the `X-Content-Type-Options` says, but that as far as this pull request goes, relying on `X-Content-Type-Options` would be OK.\r\n\r\nHowever, come to think of it, `X-Content-Type-Options` could be exploited to prevent the used of a specialized response class. So maybe it is better not to rely on `X-Content-Type-Options` for now, and maybe in the future make it possible to rely on it, opt-in, through a setting.",

(https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272#issuecomment-108393927, 2nd bullet point)\r\n\r\n-   I *wonder* if we need a ``check_configuration`` method at all, and for which scenarios.\r\n\r\nAbout anything more that than, I would like to understand how important and useful it would be, and whether or not it needs to be part of the initial implementation or can be postponed to future, backward-compatible iterations.",

          "body": "I largely agree with @Gallaecio; it seems better to aim for a minimal implementation: addon is a Python class with 2 methods: update_settings and check_final_settings (check_configuration?). No modules, no updating other addons, no provides/requires/etc. I'll comment inline about the features which we can probably drop.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**EDIT** the below is probably wrong, I should read the PR more carefully :)\r\n\r\nI think one of the possible benefits of addons is not realized in this PR: addons know which settings they have. So, if instead of \r\n\r\n```py\r\nADDONS = {MyAddon: 100}\r\nMY_ADDON_PARAMETER = \"foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe have something like this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nADDONS = {\r\n    MyAddon: {\r\n        \"priority\": 100,  # not sure about this\r\n        \"parameter\": \"foo\"\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can detect if incorrect option is passed to the addon, while MY_ADDON_PARAMTER is always going to be silently ignored.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this approach is not compatible with changing individual settings via cmdline or Scrapy Cloud, so it requires more work to become usable. So, in a spirit of simplification, we can consider it as another idea for the future :)",

          "body": "> > changing arguments based on final settings would not be possible before `__init__` with this approach, since `__init__` would be the one taking care of changing settings based on arguments\r\n> \r\n> Not sure what is this use case?\r\n\r\nI am thinking of a future where we implement argument validation and conversion as an opt-in feature by exposing a setting for a new type of Scrapy component, in line with the fingerprinter setting, e.g. `ARG_PARSER`. The default parser could keep the current behavior, i.e. leave the arguments as they are, while a new parser could implement something like pydantic to error out in case of bad input, or convert strings to dict or int.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that this setting-defined component, which could have settings of its own to control its behavior (e.g. a setting to disable exiting on error to instead only log a warning), should be executed before `__init__`, so that `__init__` would get those arguments already processed, or not be called at all if argument processing exists earlier.\r\n\r\nTo enable such a future scenario, I am thinking we should have the following order:\r\n\r\n1. existing settings editing\r\n2. (future) argument parsing based on settings\r\n3. setting editing based on (parsed) arguments\r\n4. `__init__` getting final settings and arguments.",

Still, it'd be good to test that nothing breaks in the currently tested platform. From what I can see, this is only used in the `parse` command, but their tests read from stdout/stderr which unless I'm mistaken would be read as plain text, without color information. Do you think you could add some small test for the `_colorize` or `pformat` functions? Something like `assert _colorize('{\"a\": 1}') == '{\\x1b[33m\"\\x1b[39;49;00m\\x1b[33ma\\x1b[39;49;00m\\x1b[33m\"\\x1b[39;49;00m: \\x1b[34m1\\x1b[39;49;00m}\\n'`\r\n",

This has two benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Spreading out load on the target servers instead of hitting the server with many requests at once\r\n2. Reducing delays caused by server-throttling or scrapy's own `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP` restrictions.  Empirical testing has shown this to be quite effective.\r\n\r\nIt implements the solution proposed in https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1802#issue-135260562 which found similar performance improvements.  **Original proposal** was first posted https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1802 (code no longer available), https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2474, and https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3140.  \r\n\r\n**Note:** It requires more than just using `SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_QUEUE` as it needs an API change to the queue (passing in a non-integer key, i.e. the domain, to a new round robin queue).\r\n\r\n- Implements https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3140\r\n- Depends on merged queuelib PR https://github.com/scrapy/queuelib/pull/21\r\n\r\nWould love to get feedback @pablohoffman, @dangra, and @kmike!",

Round-robin assumes requests from all domains are handled with roughly the same speed, which is not the case in a real world, esp. if you're not doing broad crawl, but crawling a specific list of domains.",

          "body": "Hey @tianhuil! Sorry for going back and forth. \r\n\r\nMy main concern is a lack of support for request priorities. There are implementations which support request priorities - in fact, all other implementations I'm aware of (mentioned in previous tickets) support request priorities - they are incomplete in different ways though. \r\n\r\nIt is not only about user-facing feature of allowing users to set custom priorities for different Requests,  like this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nscrapy.Request(url, self.parse, priority=5)  # won't work\r\n```\r\n\r\nScrapy uses request priorities itself, internally - they are used for retries and redirects; they are also a base of DepthMiddleware. \r\n\r\nNot having priority support may cause strange issues: for example, redirects won't necessarily be on top of the queue, so any redirect can potentially go to the end of the crawl, and, depending on a spider, may be never crawled - it seems to be the case if user uses FIFO queues, as recommended in FAQ [section](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html#does-scrapy-crawl-in-breadth-first-or-depth-first-order) on how to configure BFO crawl. Actually, BFO won't work at all, as DEPTH_PRIORITY won't work.\r\n\r\nThird-party packages may also rely on working request priorities; for example, https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash will work badly with queues which don't support priorities.\r\n\r\nDocumentation should be updated in several more places, maybe even regardless of the implementation:\r\n\r\n* Request [docs](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request), \r\n* [Broad Crawls](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/broad-crawls.html), \r\n* this FAQ [entry](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html#does-scrapy-crawl-in-breadth-first-or-depth-first-order).",

          "body": "@tianhuil I'm fine with almost everything which makes things better and keeps the existing features working. I haven't realized at first that not supporting priorities is not just a problem with `priority` argument, it is also a problem for retries, redirects, BFO, scrapy-splash, etc - sorry about that. So I think RoundRobin with support for priorities, adequately tested and documented, is good. There are several ways to support priorities in Round-Robin, such as:\r\n\r\n1. Priorities are respected for each domain, but domain is chosen in a round-robin fashion.\r\n2. Only requests of the same priority are chosen in a round-robin fashion; priorities are respected globally.\r\n\r\n(1) makes more sense to me as a default. We just need to make sure it is clearly documented.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEventually we should be aiming for an even more efficient scheduler. From my point of view, we're fixing a bug here: Scrapy may under-utilize the downloader by filling it with requests it can't download because of its own concurrency limits. \r\n\r\nRound-robin is a solution, but a partial one: it assumes all domains can be downloaded with the same speed. It is not always the case. For example, let's say we have domains A and B, both with many requests in a queue, and request can be finished twice as fast for domain A. Global concurrency is set to 4, and per-domain concurrency is limited to 2. With Round-Robin downloader queue will be filled like this:\r\n\r\n1. `____ -> ABAB`: requests are added in a round-robin fashion, total size is 4.\r\n2. `_BAB -> ABAB`: A is downloaded, next request is for A, we add it to the queue\r\n3. `AB_B -> ABBB`: A is downloaded (it is twice as fast), B is added according to round-robin rules\r\n4. `A_BB -> AABB`: B is downloaded, we add A\r\n5. `_ABB -> BABB`: A is downloaded, we add B\r\n6. `B_BB -> BABB`: A is downloaded, we add A\r\n7. `BAB_ -> BABB`: B is downloaded, we add B\r\n...\r\n\r\nNote how we almost always have less A requests in the downloader queue - one instead of optimal two; it means in this case there are no parallel requests to domain A, while user requested 2 parallel requests. At the same time, there are more B requests (usually 3) than can be downloaded in parallel (as the limit is 2), they're just sitting in the downloader queue, taking slots which could have been used for other domains.\r\n\r\nIn broad crawls it is rather common to get some domains which can timeout on all requests. Maybe some DNS issues. Default Scrapy timeout is 180s; with 2 retries it is 180*3=540s to process a request in a worst case. If for the \"average\" domain speed is 1s, and we download 100 domains in parallel, we may easily get downloader queue filled 4/5 (or so, I haven't estimated it properly) with requests from this slow domain, leaving less opportunity for parallelization of other domains, and so crawling slower than possible for no good reason.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue scheduler should avoid adding request to the downloader if there is no free slot for it. This is how it works in frontera. Round Robin can be modified to do the same - and that's the reason I'm fine with merging round-robin implementation - it can be modified to support this feature in future.  For example, it can keep track of the current downloader state using `request_reached_downloader` (see https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3393) and other signals, and skip adding a request from a domain if adding it would make Downloader go over concurrency limit for this domain. Instead of signals we may also query Downloader status directly.",

I'll update this as the changes come along in detail about what the individual changes concern themselves with.\n\nTo this point we have:\n- Introduced the `scrapy.dispatch` module\n- Changed all standard signals to be objects of the `Signal` class instead of the generic `object`.\n\nMost of the other stuff is outside the mainline and I'll be pushing it as soon as I'm done with it, I'll preferably have a working prototype by the end of this week(Saturday), latest by the start of the next one(the Monday after that). \n\n/cc @jdemaeyer \n",

You need to replace your imports to use either the full path or a relative one (`from dispatch import Signal` -> `from scrapy.dispatch import Signal` or `from .dispatch import Signal`, and a few others in the `dispatch` subpackage, preferably the absolute path version), you can easily see what I mean when you open a Python interpreter in the repositories base directory and simply try `import scrapy`.\n\nDid you take a look at the tests?\n",

          "body": "Great work Avishkar!\n\nI've added a few smaller notes here and there but I think this looks pretty good now. Codecov complains that not all of the newly added code is being executed during the test suite, but that will probably be remedied when we add tests for the new signalling backend.\n\nThere are two backwards compatibility issues that we should think about:\n1. All signal receivers must now accept `**kwargs`. This is a big one and will definitely break a lot of user code out there (just like it already broke a lot of internal code). In the old signalling backend, we were using [`pydispatcher`'s `robustApply` method](http://pydoc.net/Python/PyDispatcher/2.0.5/pydispatch.robustapply/) to handle receivers that weren't able to accept all keyword arguments. Can we port that to work with our new backend? And then throw a warning when we connect signal receivers that don't accept `**kwargs`, but no longer completely disallow them.\n2. As you pointed out earlier, user-defined signals will be broken, because they now need to be instances of `Signal` instead of any arbitrary object. This one is much smaller than the first issue, since user-defined signals should be rare. I think we should try to implement an easy solution if there is one but be ready to let this stand as backwards incompatible if necessary. Given that all signalling tasks go through the `SignalManager`, maybe it's possible to do something like this:\n\n``` python\nclass SignalManager(object):\n    _signal_proxies = {}\n\n    def _ensure_signal(self, obj):\n        if isinstance(obj, Signal):\n            return obj\n        # Warn user that this is deprecated here\n        self._signal_proxies.setdefault(obj, Signal())\n        return self._signal_proxies[obj]\n\n    def connect(self, receiver, signal, **kwargs):\n        signal = self._ensure_signal(signal)\n        # ...\n\n    # and similar in the other methods\n```\n\nI haven't put much thought into it though, issue 1 is definitely of higher priority.\n",

Great work!\n\nIt would be cool if you could squash the commits into a couple of \"meaningful\" ones (tip: make a tag or write down the current commit hash before calling `rebase`, it's an easy way out if you accidentally enter rebase hell ;)). Then when we have settled the remaining smaller issues (the line comments) and the benchmarks are up somewhere I think we're ready to have a second reviewer look over it and add some docs (or the other way around).\n",

          "body": "Hey @jdemaeyer , thanks for the code review. In accordance with the email I sent you, the patched receiver sending was abysmally slow when compared to the current API, and in the spirit of always coming up with overly complicated solutions, this too was due to over engineering on my part. I introduced a large amount of method call overhead as well, which was taking a lot of time too. I reworked that and completely got rid of `_patched_receivers` and instead worked using the `Signal` class itself, IMO the new approach is much simpler and cleaner, and the benchmark too is fixed(in case you didn't check the email yet, here's a link to the benchmark suite: https://github.com/rootAvish/scrapysignalbench).\n\nWould appreciate it if you had a look over that part again, do you see any problems with the new implementation?\n",

          "body": "@jdemaeyer thanks for responding on such short notice, always appreciate your insights.\n\n>  there's still three that are open from earlier commits. (Btw these are never commands or anything, feel free to answer with why you disagree.)\n\nSorry for missing out on those, I don't disagree, I thought you wanted to deliberate further on deprecating `utils.signal` further so I didn't move on it at the time, I thought it would be too much of a change but then I considered that the utils pass-through methods are not directly usable after the change anyway, plus it also gets rid of the method call overhead.\n\n> So this leaves us with the following stuff still to do, right?\n> smaller issues (line comments)  \n\nI think I took care of all of them all (I think, I'll make sure to go over all of them again to make sure I didn't miss any like before).\n\n> squash commits  \n\nRight, I wanted to do that once I was done with the development.\n\n> finish docs\n\nI'm almost done with those, I'll upload them sometime later today. I did the docstrings for `dispatcher.py` as a starting point, I tried to adhere to the formatting style used in Scrapy.\n\n> If you find time for it, maybe you can put the output for the benchmark suite somewhere (just a raw paste of the command line output should be fine)?\n\nHey sure, I thought you would like to run the same on your end for verification so I didn't include my run at first, here's a sample: https://github.com/rootAvish/scrapysignalbench/blob/master/scrapysignalbench/benchmarks/README.md\n\nAs you can see, in theory connection is slower than before but most of that time is used up in checking for kwargs and raising the deprecation warning(line_profiler output that I went by in the past suggest so), in time further down the road we can always look to migrate away from non-kwargs receivers completely. Do you think slower connection times an issue?\n",

But XPath... it's a foreign language that mostly does what CSS selectors do \u2014 but those are second language to me. Anyone coming from jQuery or CSS will already be used to CSS selectors.\n\nSo I decided to improve scrapy to support CSS selectors, using the cssselect package that got extracted from the lxml package. I've created two Selector classes, HtmlCSSSelector and XmlCSSSelector, that basically translate the CSS selectors into XPath selectors and run the parent class select method. Easy Peasy.\n\nI'm looking into how to provide tests for these new classes, but would love some guidance. This is my first contribution to a Python package.\n",

          "body": "Great @barraponto, I look forward to those changes to merge this PR.\n\nThe CSSMixin code looks OK to me.\n\nOne thing I'm not so sure is about using `extras_require` instead of (the more standard) `install_requires`. On one hand, it's more elegant/correct to do it that way, but on the other it makes installation slightly more complex with a somewhat obscure setuptools feature.\n\nMy reasons in favor of using `install_requires`:\n- CSS selectors would be a new nice core feature (anything not in scrapy.contrib is)\n- simplifies setup by giving you a fully functional (batteries included) installation of Scrapy, regardless of how you install it. As a policy, all stuff not in scrapy.contrib should run with the default dependencies.\n- cssselect is pure python, so multi-platform support shouldn't be an issue (because pip/easy_install should pull all dependencies automatically). If it were a binary package, I would worry much more about adding it as a mandatory dependency because of cross-platform issues.\n- we did the same with PyOpenSSL (in fact, we should probably remove the 'ssl' from optional features) and it's even a binary package.\n- cssselect seems like a reasonably well maintained project and not likely to go away soon. But, even if it goes away, we could replace it by another (better maintained) library like we did with libxml2 -> lxml, since the scrapy selectors API won't expose any internal cssselect API.\n",

          "body": "A quick excerpt from [CSS Selectors Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#pseudo-elements):\n\n> Pseudo-elements create abstractions about the document tree beyond those specified by the document language. For instance, document languages do not offer mechanisms to access the first letter or first line of an element's content. Pseudo-elements allow authors to refer to this otherwise inaccessible information. Pseudo-elements may also provide authors a way to refer to content that does not exist in the source document (e.g., the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements give access to generated content).\n> \n> Only one pseudo-element may appear per selector, and if present it must appear after the sequence of simple selectors that represents the subjects of the selector.\n\nMind the last paragraph. I started porting a scraper to the pseudo-class syntax introduced earlier, and it feels weird: `h3:text` shouldn't select anything, because there's no h3 element that is a text node, so I had to write `h3 :text` which implies `h3 *:text`. Just weird, and opens up to weird stuff like `h3 > :text` or `h3 + :attribute`.\n\nPseudo-elements, on the other hand, are anchored to the last selector, like `h3::text` (getting any text content inside all of h3 elements) or `h3::string` getting all of the text contents inside h3 elements (`hello world` in `<h3>hello </span>world</span></h3>`).\n\nBy the way, attr() is already used in CSS as a value for the `content` property (see [specs](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#x18)). So I guess `::attr()` is better than `:attribute`.\n",

It allows implementing universal support in spiders, akin to what we did with spider middlewares and their `_async`-suffixed methods, but is slightly better since the async name here is final.\r\n\r\n    -   How will the deprecation work?\r\n\r\n        We add `start()` definitions to all built-in spiders while keeping their `start_requests()` definitions.\r\n\r\n        The engine uses `start()`. Since its default implementation iterates `start_requests()`, old code should continue to work.\r\n\r\n        > **Note:** Things are a bit different when spider middlewares are involved, see the details about the deprecation of `SpiderMiddleware.process_start_requests()` below.\r\n\r\n        We inspect the MRO of the running spider class from the engine, and log a deprecation warning if the first class defining `start_requests()` does not also define `start()`. In other words, every spider class (even base classes) must be either new style (define `start()` only) or universal (define both) to silence the deprecation warning.\r\n\r\n        In the future, once we decide that `start_requests()` has overstayed its welcome, we log a deprecation warning also for universal spider classes, and remove `start_requests()` from all built-in spiders, moving their code to the matching `start()` methods.\r\n\r\n    -   Why `start()`?\r\n\r\n        [Because](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/6729#discussion_r2000763590).\r\n\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n-   Deprecate `SpiderMiddleware.process_start_requests()` in favor of a new, async `SpiderMiddleware.process_start()` with a single `start: AsyncIterable[Any]` parameter.\r\n\r\n    <details>\r\n\r\n    <summary>FAQ</summary>\r\n\r\n    -   Why deprecate `process_start_requests()` instead of allowing to define it as a coroutine?\r\n\r\n        Same reasons as for `Spider.start()`.\r\n\r\n    -   How will the deprecation work?\r\n\r\n        The engine checks all enabled spider middlewares, and if any enabled spider middleware defines `process_start_requests()` and not `process_start()`:\r\n\r\n        -   If the running spider is new style, or if there is any new-style-only spider middleware, close the spider with an error. In other words, no downgrade/upgrade support, to keep things simpler on our end.\r\n\r\n        -   Else, log a deprecation warning, and use `start_requests()` instead of `start()`, but wrap the whole thing in an `AsyncIterable`  so that everything else in the code base remains the same.\r\n\r\n        In the future, when removing `start_requests()` support, we should also start logging a deprecation warning for spider middlewares that define `process_start_requests()`.\r\n\r\n    -   Why name the method `process_start()` and the parameter `start`?\r\n\r\n        I feel these are nice and consistent with `Spider.start()`.\r\n\r\n    -   Why remove the `spider` parameter?\r\n\r\n        I feel like passing the `spider` parameter around is an anachronism from a time when a crawler could be used for multiple spiders, which [has not been the case for many years](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/5eb429999e9e6a49eb9721d2dc0a47e0100345c3).\r\n\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n-   Implement `crawler.signals.wait_for` and a `scheduler_empty` signal to allow reproducing the old behavior.\r\n\r\n-   Document how to prioritize start requests over callback requests, and how to ensure start requests are sorted (with priorities, i.e. without changing the scheduler queue from LIFO to FIFO).\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n-   Switched to autodoc for parts of the API where I needed to edit the reference docs.\r\n\r\n-   Switched from inlineCallbacks to deferred_f_from_coro_f in touched code, where possible.\r\n\r\n-   Changed all `AsyncIterable` typing to `AsyncIterator` ([reason](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/6729#discussion_r2016375104)).\r\n\r\n**Post-merge to-do:**\r\n\r\n-   [ ] Add a comment to https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/4842 to mention that there is now a `start` subfolder for start requests.",

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.\u00ae\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work? Only paid users can view reports and post statuses/comments. ",

I believe that, with an extremely low response time, there is a chance for a race condition where there is no room for the callback request to be yielded before `needs_backout` becomes `False` again (because the response was received quickly) and a new start() request gets scheduled as a result.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "This PR adds support for defining `async def parse_*` and using both `yield` and `await` inside, with or without the asyncio reactor. There is one caveat: if the asyncio reactor is enabled, you cannot await on Deferreds directly and need to wrap them. I've added this to docs.\r\n\r\nThis change was tested on two real-world projects, for one of them I also replaced using `inline_requests` to get HTTP responses inside a callback with alternatively `treq` or `aiohttp`. I didn't test the performance, but as far as I can see the existing non-async callbacks shouldn't have any significant code path changes so there should be no regressions and if there are any perf problems with async callbacks we can solve that later.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't require or support async def start_requests.\r\n\r\nMy main concern with this is large and non-intuitive `scrapy.utils.defer._AsyncCooperatorAdapter`. I would like to replace it with something better if that's possible but for now it seems to work correctly. I've tried to document it as comprehensively as possible.\r\n\r\nI've split it in several commits with different features in case this help with review for someone.",

On the other hand, `d.callback()` already checks for the same thing which makes 1.5 of these 2 checks redundant. \r\n\r\nAs for `def __iter__`, that's just the iterable protocol, but as `Cooperator.coiterate` says it takes an iterator we can drop it.\r\n\r\nI'll look at `_process_iterable_universal` coverage.",

          "body": "Moving the middleware discussion to the top level.\r\n\r\nThese seem to be set in stone:\r\n\r\n1. We want user projects with all-sync code to still work, and not even produce warnings, and ideally use the same code paths as before.\r\n2. Similar for old 3rd-party middlewares (so all-sync too).\r\n3. If the user project switches some callback to async we are fine with requiring modification of user middlewares in that project and/or emitting warnings for code in that project.\r\n4. Whatever the user does, we shouldn't mandate things that are incompatible with each other or in some other way cause  a user project to not be able to convert.\r\n5. \"Simple\" 3rd-party middlewares (ones that don't use async features and maybe ones that can optionally use them for things like performance or optional features, so a majority of them) should be able to maintain code that works with both old Scrapy and with new Scrapy+async user code.\r\n6. If a user project has all code as async and no \"legacy\" (whatever that means) 3rd-party middlewares it should work without things like implicit downgrades.\r\n\r\nNow the discussion points:\r\n\r\n7. What to do with builtin middlewares: keep them sync, make them async, make them universal?\r\n8. What to do with 3rd party middlewares in various cases? There may be several separate things here depending on the middleware.\r\n9. Is there a path to the future where all code is async or does it require breaking so much that we don't need to think about it now?\r\n10. If we want some universal middlewares, how to handle them in Scrapy?\r\n11. How to help people with writing universal middlewares (user or 3rd party)?\r\n12. Is it possible to make some of this easier by e.g. providing a separate async method instead of trying to use the same name for both kinds?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor 7, keeping them sync is not an option as that will cause downgrades for 6. Making them async, as mentioned above, will cause upgrades-downgrades too, at least if a sync middleware is present, which breaks 1 as it will produce warnings, and also the code paths will be more complicated and we would want to not have surprises with large projects just upgrading the Scrapy version. So it looks like we want to make them universal. This doesn't seem to cause any problems except somewhat complicating the middleware code and requiring actual support for universal middlewares in Scrapy.\r\n\r\nFor 8, we'll need to enumerate cases to discuss them separately:\r\n- The middleware is not updated yet, and maybe won't be updated soon (as it's not maintained anymore, or just doesn't need any async support) - we want these to work and they should, but with downgrading. Here I think we should just say \"this is much better than not supporting them at all\" and move on.\r\n- The middleware requires async - this should work fine, but if there are also some sync middlewares used there can be downgrades. Similar to the previous case.\r\n- The middleware doesn't require async but wants to benefit from it if it's available - this is interesting as there can be non-obvious solutions here (like switching to async code only if it's detected as supported etc.)\r\n- The middleware doesn't require async but should support everything in the best ways possible - looks like it should just be made universal, unless we find other options.\r\n\r\nFor 9, we'll need to think some more on it but so far it looks like the move will be smooth, with dropping sync support in various places.\r\n\r\nFor 10, there is one problem: Scrapy cannot know before calling a method whether it's universal (takes both sync and async iterables) or not (takes async iterables only if it's `inspect.isasyncgenfunction`), and the only solution I see is adding some flag to the function object (which in practice requires a decorator) or maybe renaming the function.\r\n\r\nFor 11, as mentioned earlier we cannot ship any helpers in Scrapy as the 3rd party middleware code needs to work with old Scrapy too, but we can provide snippets in docs.\r\n\r\nFor 12, we need to research what benefits will making a new method name give us and whether it will cause problems in the future when dropping sync support.",

          "body": "@ianozsvald we are working on it, it is a priority :) \n\nScrapy is the worst kind of project to port to Python 3 - it depends on Twisted (which is not ported to Python 3 yet - some subset of Twisted works though), and it works at outside world / python world boundary, so there are many questions about unicode. \"Outer World\" Scrapy works with is wild - there is no a well-defined encoding we can decode/encode data from/to. Encoding rules are sometimes crazy - e.g. browsers (which Scrapy aims to emulate) can use different charsets for different _parts_ of a single URL, e.g. cp1251 for /path and utf-8 for GET parameter values. I've ported a lot of code to Python 3 (including most of NLTK and tens of other Python packages), but still getting porting details wrong for Scrapy (e.g. https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/837 is wrong).\n\nSome parts of Scrapy are already ported to Python 3. We're running tests for Python 3.3 on Travis to prevent regressions; ~240 tests pass in 3.3, out of ~1000. There is a GSoC project to port Scrapy to Python 3.x; I think we should make a good progress this summer.\n",

You are a man of many projects :-) Glad to hear it is being worked on, I didn't get that impression from the early parts of this thread and couldn't see any other porting docs. I quite agree that this project (just like Flask et al.) is going to be hard, dealing with the interface to the outside world is horrid. I certainly didn't know that URLs themselves could have mixed encodings :-(\nGiven the continual migration to Python 3 for personal projects (50/50 according to the survey I linked vs Python 2.7) and >40% for work, the need for scrapy's Py3 support is only going to get stronger.

Although maybe that is less likely to happen, since the CLI is intended for simpler usage. Yet again, from that point of view, we could let the CLI interface as is, and not allow specifying multiple output files from the CLI, only through spider settings.",

This is a feature I would very much like to see in Scrapy :rocket:  \r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI thought about adding documentation for the `FEED_URI_PARAMS` setting, which I think has been always undocumented, but since it relies in `load_object` I think it would be best to wait for #3873.

This was not introduced by this PR, so it should be addressed in a separate PR IMHO.\r\n* If a Response subclass object is returned as part of the iterable, Scrapy complains with `ERROR: Spider must return Request, BaseItem, dict or None, got 'HtmlResponse'`. As stated in [this doc page](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html#scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_exception) responses might be returned as part of that iterable, but I'm not sure about the desired behaviour: is this a problem with Scrapy or with the docs?\r\n(**Update**: reading the docs carefully, I think it doesn't make sense for `process_spider_exception` to return responses as part of the iterable, since that iterable will be passed to the `process_spider_output` chain, which is supposed to receive requests, dicts or items; I believe the error is in the docs).",

          "body": "After several failed attempts I think I have come up with a solution for this problem. I updated the implementation, tests and docs. The main goal here is to make the middleware chain to behave like a Twisted deferred, jumping between the process_spider_output and process_spider_exception methods from each enabled middleware as if they were callbacks/errbacks (see https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html#visual-explanation).\r\nI made a sketch of how the input/output chains will look after this change, it's just a picture of my whiteboard but if the changes are good we can probably get a designer to make a nice diagram to include in the docs. I also included a behavior table as Mikhail suggested. \r\n\r\nRegarding performance, I ran a test using `scrapy-bench`, modifying the spider in that tool to yield the results, there seems to be no noticeable impact (command: `scrapy-bench --n-runs=10 --book_url=http://localhost:8080/books bookworm)\r\n`):\r\n```\r\nmaster branch (258121db, 2018-07-18), spider returns list\r\nMean : 49.55994650734702 Median : 50.03054505433736 Std Dev : 1.6747484769938523\r\n\r\nmaster branch (258121db, 2018-07-18), spider returns generator\r\nMean : 51.30306411841985 Median : 51.565729573433515 Std Dev : 2.244161762734139\r\n\r\nprocess_spider_exception_generator branch (20defa2e, 2018-07-19), spider returns list\r\nMean : 50.69768225842105 Median : 50.8686334029228 Std Dev : 0.9180605567200794\r\n\r\nprocess_spider_exception_generator branch (20defa2e, 2018-07-19), spider returns generator\r\nMean : 50.10554590818768 Median : 49.88208980828408 Std Dev : 3.0805330389799663\r\n```\r\n\r\n@kmike, @dangra please take a look!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n| Number | Exception raised in | Generator? | Previous behavior | Current behavior | Notes |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | process_spider_input | N/A | request errback if present, process_spider_exception chain otherwise | (unchanged) |  |\r\n| 2 | request callback | Yes | The exception is logged. process_spider_exception chain is not invoked | process_spider_exception chain, starting from the first middleware | Fixed by this PR |\r\n| 3 | request callback | No | process_spider_exception chain, starting from the first middleware | (unchanged) |  |\r\n| 4 | process_spider_output | Yes | The exception is logged. process_spider_exception chain is not invoked | process_spider_exception chain, starting from the next middleware | Fixed by this PR.

          "body": "I think one of the major open questions is where the add-on manager should live. Here's an excerpt from my proposal on that (I have opted for the inside of crawler option for the SEP so far):\n\n#### Integration into existing start-up process\n\nThe question where the add-on manager should be instantiated and when the add-on callbacks should be called is not as obvious as it may seem at first glance. Outlined below are three options and their rationale:\n\n##### Outside of crawler\n\nBesides the different priority and level of direct user involvement, settings made by the add-on callbacks are not different from settings made in `settings.py`. The callbacks should therefore be called around the same time that the settings module is loaded. This puts the instantiation of an `AddonManager` instance outside of the `Crawler` instance.\n\nGiven that the project settings are read in the `get_project_settings()` function in `scrapy.util.project`, this seems a reasonable place to call `AddonManager.update_settings()`. However, we cannot instantiate the add-on manager within this function, as the function is left (and the manager would therefore be lost) long before the crawler becomes ready (when we wish to call the second round of add-on callbacks).\n\nThere are two possible approaches to instantiating the add-on manager outside of `get_project_settings()`:\n1. In a normal Scrapy start via the command-line tool, calling `get_project_settings()` is embedded into the `execute()` function in `scrapy.cmdline`. In summary, the changes to this function would be (with analogoue changes in `scrapy/conf.py`, where necessary, for backwards-compatibility):\n   1. Instantiate add-on manager before calling `get_project_settings()`\n   2. Pass add-on manager to `get_project_settings()` when calling it (the function then calls `update_settings()`).\n   3. Connect the manager's `check_configuration` method to the `engine_started` signal (this could also be done in the add-on managers '**init**()' method)\n2. Alternatively, we could (grudgingly) introduce another singleton to Scrapy (e.g. `scrapy.addonmanager.addonmanager`). This would allow moving the above code related to add-on management above into the more appropriate `get_project_settings()` function.\n\nIntegrating add-on management outside of the crawler ensures that settings management, except for spider-specific settings, remains within a rather small part of the start-up process (before instantiating a `Crawler`): the helper function `get_project_settings()` indeed keeps returning the full set of project (i.e. non-spider) settings. The downside is that it either introduces a new singleton or clutters up a function (`execute()`) that should be more about parsing command line options and starting a crawler process than about loading add-ons and settings.\n\n##### Inside of crawler\n\nThe settings used to crawl are not complete until the spider-specific settings have been loaded in `Crawler.__init__()`. Add-on management could follow this approach and only start loading add-ons when the crawler is initialised.\n\nInstantiation and the call to `AddonManager.update_settings()` would happen in `Crawler.__init__()`. The final checks (i.e. the callback to `AddonManager.check_configuration()`) could then again either be tied to the `engine_started` signal, or coded into the `Crawler.crawl()` method after creating the engine.\n\nIntegrating add-on management inside of the crawler avoids introducing a new singleton or cluttering up the `execute()` function, but rips apart compiling the complete configuration settings. This is especially critical since many of the settings previously made in `settings.py` will move to `scrapy.cfg` with the implementation of this proposal, and may prove backwards-incompatible since the `get_project_settings()` helper function no longer works as expected (and as its name suggests).\n",

In Scrapy we renamed SpiderManager to SpiderLoader because of that.

          "body": "Hey @kmike, thanks for the feedback!\n\n> 1 . Is it a coincidence that scrapy.Spider implements update_settings method which addons will implement?\n\nThat is on purpose. `Spider.update_settings()` and the add-on `update_settings()` both do roughly the same, i.e. update settings outside of `settings.py`, albeit with a different level of \"generality\"\n\n> 2 . Addons are utilities to auto-update and check Settings objects? Why do they need Crawler?\n\nAdd-ons should create a plug-and-play experience for the user. For checking that everything \"Works As Advertised\u2122\", and provide help when it doesn't, they need to know the actual state of the crawler, and not just how its state is supposed to be from the configuration. E.g. an extension listed in `settings['EXTENSIONS']` could have thrown `NotConfigured`. Add-ons can only detect this if they have access to the crawler.\n\n> 3 . How can user activate an addon when crawling is started by CrawlerRunner or CrawlerProcess?\n\nHm, don't both of these instantiate `Crawler` objects where the add-on manager would then be instantiated and load add-ons? Then again I guess it again comes down to whether a `scrapy.cfg` exists in these use cases (also see answer to 6).\n\n> 4 . How can user enable an addon if there is no Scrapy project?\n> 5 . How to enable an addon if scrapy runspider is used to start a spider?\n\nThat would not be possible with the current suggested implementation. Just like you cannot have a `settings.py` file or use `scrapyd-deploy` in these cases. It could be made possible if add-on configuration were to live in `settings` using per-spider settings. I'll put the (current) rationale for `scrapy.cfg` below.\n\n> 6 . Why is scrapy.cfg needed? It is confusing to have two config files, and it is an unnecessary boilerplate if you don't have a Scrapy project.\n\nI opted for `scrapy.cfg` for two reasons:\n1. Its syntax is more user-friendly for uninitiated users\n2. It makes it easy to keep settings local through the ini sections. E.g. something like this:\n   \n   ``` ini\n     [mysql-pipe]\n     server = some.server\n     port = 1234\n     user = a\n     password = b\n   \n     [mongodb-pipe]\n     server = some.other.server\n     user = c\n     password = d\n   ```\n   \n   is much easier in `scrapy.cfg` than in `settings.py`, and would not have to expose anything into the `settings` object, avoiding possible nameclashes.\n\nI think if done properly, users won't have to touch `settings.py` for any of the shipped add-ons at all (instead they could set, say `HTTPCACHE_DIR`, in the `scrapy.cfg`. We could even tidy up the settings namespace this way). Those users that then need to touch `settings.py` will most probably know what they're doing anyways.\n\n> 7 . In the SEP it is said that MiddlewareManager.from_settings() will be changed to allow python objects instead of class paths. Why should it be specific to MiddlewareManager? (see discussion at #1215).\n\nUh, I didn't see #1215 before, that looks good. The SEP goes a little further than the PR though: It suggests to allow not only classes, but _instances_. This will allow add-ons to instantiate components and keep settings as local as possible. Objects retrieved from `X = load_object()` are (so far) always assumed to be classes and then instantiated with `y = X()`. That should probably stay that way, and it is a good question where the \"allow instances\" code could live so it is as generic as possible.\n\n> 8 . Do you think it is possible to make Scrapy addons feature less framework-ish? In the current proposal Scrapy calls various AddonManager methods during the standard scrapy crawl init sequence, and AddonManager calls various addon methods itself. Can we made it so that user can also use the AddonManger (or individual addon) to update or check settings, without invoking all the scrapy crawl machinery?\n\nHm, I'd say it is already quite modular. The user could in principle instantiate their own `AddonManager` and hand it the `.cfg` file. Or they could load an add-on object and call its `update_settings()` method directly.\n\n> 9 . It looks like the proposed AddonManager does two unrelated things:\n> - it loads addon classes from scrapy.cfg;\n> - it uses loaded addons to update settings and check crawler.\n>   IMHO it is better to separate those. Scrapy users who don't use scrapy crawl command may prefer to import addon classes themselves, or these classes can be in the same module as CrawlerProcess call and a spider, all in the same self-contained Python script.\n\nThat is a good point. The Manager idea arised from the #591 discussion, but now that I come to think of it splitting it up seems to make more sense. Also, it would avoid having a \"...Manager\" named class :). The loaded add-ons need to live somewhere between loading <-> updating <-> checking, though. With the current SEP, that could be in an attribute of `Crawler` (much like extensions).\n\nMaybe like this?\n- An `AddonLoader` class, or even only a function, is handed the `scrapy.cfg` file and provides/returns an `{ 'addon name': (<addon object>, <addon config>) }` dict. The `check_dependency_clashes()` functionality also lives within this class/function.\n- The `addons` dict is given to the `Crawler` object upon instantiation, much like `settings`.\n- `Crawler` calls the add-ons `update_settings()` and `check_configuration()` functions at appropriate times.\n- If the user does not want the `Crawler` to call the callbacks (e.g. because she does it somewhere else), she hands over an empty addons dict on instantiation. In this case, it might be tricky that the `check_configuration()` callback requires the crawler object.\n\nI'm still quite unhappy about the `scrapy.cfg`/`settings.py` issue. It is indeed annoying overhead to have two configuration files. But then, I think it makes sense that add-ons and their configuration are not present in any `Settings` instance, and the `scrapy.cfg` syntax is very much suited for user-friendliness and local settings.\n",

Spider.update_settings() and the add-on update_settings() both do roughly the same, i.e. update settings outside of settings.py, albeit with a different level of \"generality\"\n\nHm, do you think we can use exactly the same code path for Spider then? I.e. maybe spider can implement addon interface itself? I'm not sure when can it be useful, but why not :) This way a spider will be able not only to update settings, but also to check them.\n\n> It makes it easy to keep settings local through the ini sections. E.g. something like this: (... snip ...) is much easier in scrapy.cfg than in settings.py, and would not have to expose anything into the settings object, avoiding possible nameclashes.\n\nI don't think it is a problem to separate sections in settings.py. Django-like approach works:\n\n```\nMYSQL_PIPE = dict(\n    server='some-server',\n    port=1234,\n    user='foo',\n    password='bar'\n)\n```\n\n> Maybe like this? ...\n\nYeah, your approach looks good to me.\n\nSome questions:\n\nWhy are `{ 'addon name': (<addon object>, <addon config>) }` dicts needed, what are keys ('addon names') for? Can it be a list of `(<addon class>, <addon config>)` pairs, or just a list of instantiated addon objects?\n\n> I'm still quite unhappy about the scrapy.cfg/settings.py issue. It is indeed annoying overhead to have two configuration files. But then, I think it makes sense that add-ons and their configuration are not present in any Settings instance, and the scrapy.cfg syntax is very much suited for user-friendliness and local settings.\n\nWhat's the problem with having ADDONS list in settings.py? It means one less config file and more flexibility - addons will be able to disable or enable or check other addons. This way you also avoid changing Crawler API and other realted APIs - no need to add 'addons' argument. I think that two config files is less user-friendly than one config file. By default settings.py may contain only this ADDONS option.\n",

I could use the first part of `os.env['SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE']` but it seems to me that there should be a cleaner way.\n\nAgain, thanks for the feedback @kmike!\n\n> Hm, do you think we can use exactly the same code path for Spider then?\n\nI think that should be possible, but I'm not sure how enforce that the `update_settings()` method is not called twice.\n\n> I don't think it is a problem to separate sections in settings.py. Django-like approach works:\n\nOne problem with the current SEP is that the add-on name (= variable name) is allowed to be a python path to the add-on, but python does not allow dots in variable names. I have therefore allowed a `_name` variable in the `settings.py` dicts for now.\n\n> Why are { 'addon name': (<addon object>, <addon config>) } dicts needed, what are keys ('addon names') for? Can it be a list of (<addon class>, <addon config>) pairs, or just a list of instantiated addon objects?\n\nThe keys are simply whatever the addon was called in `scrapy.cfg`/`settings.py`. I'm not yet fully sure if we can drop it this early so I'd prefer to leave it in. It cannot be a list of instantiated add-on objects with the current SEP b/c we also allow add-ons to be modules right now (i.e. cannot be instantiated)\n\nI don't really like the idea of exposing add-ons in the global settings, because they are essentially \"one level above it\": Add-ons fiddle with settings and extensions, but never the other way around. That's why I've designed the settings module add-on loader to only load variables starting with `addon_` (in lower case, so they're not picked up by `Settings.setmodule()`) so far. It would be cool to allow add-ons to load/configure other add-ons, though. In that case an add-on manager could become useful again...\n",

There are just too many cross-dependencies: I wanted the holder to still be able to load add-ons last minute (allowing add-ons to load other add-ons, though I'm not exactly sure whether we want to allow this) and check dependency issues, at the same time get rid of the confusing `{ used_key:  (addon, configuration) }` structure if the loader.\n\nNow, the `AddonManager` provides two class methods that the user may use when she doesn't want to use the 'holding' part, and provides convenience methods to add add-ons in case she doesn't want to use the 'loading' part.\n\nI have integrated the add-on system into Scrapy's start-up process (it currently reads from both `scrapy.cfg` and the settings module), but did no testing of a \"fully integrated\" system so far.\n\nOne issue currently in my head is: Do we allow add-ons to load/configure other add-ons?

          "body": "I've put some thought into the \"add-ons loading/configuring other add-ons\" issue. The big problem with the current implementation is that the first time code of an add-on is executed is during the first round of callbacks to `update_settings()`. Should an add-on load or reconfigure another add-on here, other add-ons might already have been called. While it is possible to ensure that the `update_settings()` method of the newly added add-on is called, there is no guarantee (and in fact, it is quite unlikely) that all add-ons see the same add-on configuration in their `update_settings()`.\n\nI see three possible approaches to this:\n1. Forbid add-ons from loading or configuring other add-ons. In this case 'umbrella add-ons' would not be possible and all cross-configuration dependencies would again be burdened onto the user.\n2. Forbid add-ons to do _any_ kind of settings introspection in `update_settings()`, instead only allow them to do changes to the `settings` object or load other add-ons. In this case, configuring _already enabled_ add-ons should be avoided, as there is no guarantee that their `update_settings()` method has not already been called\n3. Add a third callback, `update_addons(config, addonmgr)`, to the add-on interface. Only loading and configuring other add-ons should be done in this method. While it may be allowed, developers should be aware that depending on `config` (of their own add-on, i.e. the one whose `update_addons()` is currently called) is fragile, as once again, there is no guarantee in which order add-ons will be called back and whether some other add-on will want to touch `config`.\n\nCurrently I have implemented option 2. I have not quite made up my mind about it just yet, but I think I option 3 is my favourite for now.\n",

          "body": "The twisted error when testing `check_configure()` is a little tricky, and it's actually something that wasn't handled before.\n\n> ```\n> ====================================================== FAILURES ======================================================\n> ___________________________________ CrawlTestCase.test_abort_on_addon_failed_check ___________________________________\n> NOTE: Incompatible Exception Representation, displaying natively:\n> \n> DirtyReactorAggregateError: Reactor was unclean.\n> DelayedCalls: (set twisted.internet.base.DelayedCall.debug = True to debug)\n> <DelayedCall 0x7ff8a481a950 [59.7946248055s] called=0 cancelled=0 LoopingCall<60>(Downloader._slot_gc, *(), **{})()>\n> ```\n\nThis output means there's a pending call that wasn't stopped properly. In that case is a twisted LoopingCall [started by the Downloader](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/core/downloader/__init__.py#L88). The downloader is stored in the engine, so that call reference can be accessed in a crawler as `crawler.engine.downloader._slot_gc_loop`.\n\nThe engine is instantiated [in Crawler.crawl()](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/scrapy/blob/enhancement/addons/scrapy/crawler.py#L77). Problem is, that call is already running when `check_configure()` is called and fails in FailedCheckAddon, but there is no place that addresses that and closes the downloader (which stops the looping call) properly. Not sure why that wasn't handled for errors happening after creating the engine, I guess it's not noticeable unless running tests that tell you about it.\n\nSo, there are two ways of fixing this. First one is to move the line calling `addons.check_configuration()` above the instantiation of the engine. This would fix the test but doesn't help solving the underlining problem. Second approach would be to close the downloader if any problem raises from the commands after the engine creation. Something like:\n\n``` python\ntry:\n    self.spider = self._create_spider(*args, **kwargs)\n    self.engine = self._create_engine()\n    self.addons.check_configuration(self)\n    ...\n   except Exception:\n       self.crawling = False\n       if self.engine is not None:\n            self.engine.downloader.close()\n       raise\n```\n\nshould be enough. If you want to you can implement this fix in this pr (or in another one) or we can implement it at some other time and follow the first approach for now.\n\nLast thing about the test: I'd refrain to use `self.assertFailure()` if possible, it's something present in `trial` and not in the builtin `unittest` that can be omitted. This should work too:\n\n``` python\n@defer.inlineCallbacks\ndef test_abort_on_addon_failed_check(self):\n    class FailedCheckAddon(Addon):\n        NAME = 'FailedCheckAddon'\n        VERSION = '1.0'\n        def check_configuration(self, crawler):\n            raise ValueError\n    crawler = get_crawler(SimpleSpider)\n    crawler.addons.add(FailedCheckAddon())\n    with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n        yield crawler.crawl()\n```\n",

          "body": "I think there are some things to discuss about the design, I took note on some questions and suggestions I had so we can talk them through.\n\nThere are some concerns about the usage of the `scrapy.cfg` file to set the addons configuration. I agree here with @kmike that we need to support using the current settings for a couple of reasons:\n- I'm not sure if we can maintain the locality of the addons configuration. This could be backward incompatible when scrapy components get ported, there could be addons that depend in other addons config. Not sure if I'm stretching the issue, but at least it was mentioned in #1334 (sharing a `retry` setting with `redirect` middlewares).\n- As mentioned earlier in the pr, `scrapy.cfg` can't be the only way of configuring addons because having a project is not required for running scrapy, setting core components is something that should be possible with single spiders.\n- We can't remove the already present flexibly of configuring components dynamically via command line or `custom_settings`. \n\nBoth options, using the current settings and the `scrapy.cfg` files could coexist, but if there is any complication keeping both we should favor the first one.\n\nOn a related note, I'm not sure it's a good idea to discard `_ENABLED` settings (read about discarding them in the SEP), specially if we're keeping the possibility of dynamic configuration. Users may want to disable a component temporary without deleting or commenting out the whole `.cfg` section.\n\nSome miscellaneous comments in the addons interface:\n- Related with what I mentioned before, if we loose settings locality, is it required to instantiate the addons so early in the loading process? Could `update_settings()` and `check_configuration()` be class methods?\n- An idea :) There could be more non-required attributes in the zope.interface with general information about the addons, for example, some field with a brief description, a dictionary detailing the settings that the addon reads, maybe a list with some non-required dependencies. This sort of copies some utilities from python packages, I wonder if we can make a specific interface for python packages that grabs these settings (name, version, dependencies, etc.) using setuptools.\n- I think we should add a field in the addons (maybe not required?) where the devs could set a fixed number denoting the loading order position for that addon. I know that we have REQUIRES/MODIFIES/PROVIDES to try to address that, but I doubt this is going to be enough to define all cases.\n- A detail, is it ok to enforce having a `check_configuration()` method in the addons? I understand `update_settings()` being required, addons' only connection with the crawling engine is by updating the settings, there is no point in not having this method, but enforcing `check_configuration()` seems a little restrictive. We could check in `AddonManager.check_configuration()` if the method exists or not and call it in the first case.\n",

          "body": "Pheew okay, improving the error handling in `Crawler.crawl()` took me an awful lot of time and I learned quite a bit about Deferreds and Scrapy's architectural details. I'm still really unhappy, so here's what I have, up for discussion. ;) (Sorry for the wall of text, I'm doing this also to sort out my thoughts)\n\nSo I put in the\n\n``` python\n       if self.engine is not None:\n            self.engine.downloader.close()\n```\n\nin the `Crawler.crawl()` `except` clause as you suggested, and the test I had worked fine. But of course I wanted to introduce that code The Right Way\u2122 so I wrote another test that checks whether the crawler shuts down gracefully when there's any error during the crawl startup process.\n\nThe test is in `tests.test_crawl.CrawlTestCase.test_graceful_crawl_error_handling`. I mocked `ExecutionEngine.start` to throw an exception and asserted that `Crawler.crawling == False` and that the downloader's `close` method has been called (although I couldn't figure out how to properly wrap the mock around the original method):\n\n``` python\n    @defer.inlineCallbacks\n    def test_graceful_crawl_error_handling(self):\n        crawler = get_crawler(SimpleSpider)\n        class TestError(Exception):\n            pass\n        from scrapy.core.downloader import Downloader\n        Downloader._orig_close = Downloader.close\n        def close_downloader(*args, **kwargs):\n            # Ugly work-around since I couldn't get supplying\n            # wraps=Downloader.close to the mock to work...\n            Downloader._orig_close(crawler.engine.downloader)\n\n        with mock.patch('scrapy.crawler.ExecutionEngine.start') as mock_es, \\\n             mock.patch.object(Downloader, 'close') as mock_dc:\n            mock_es.side_effect = TestError\n            mock_dc.side_effect = close_downloader\n            with self.assertRaises(TestError):\n                yield crawler.crawl()\n            self.assertFalse(crawler.crawling)\n            self.assertTrue(mock_dc.called)\n```\n\nNow I got a different delayed call remaining after the test: `<DelayedCall 0x7f069902cab8 [59.7916400433s] called=0 cancelled=0 LoopingCall<60.0>(LogStats.log, *(<SimpleSpider 'simple' at 0x7f06992bbd90>,), **{})()`. I figured (after _a while_) that I needed to close the spider through the engine. However, as `ExecutionEngine.close_spider()` also closes the downloader, I need a case separation for the graceful shutdown. So here's what it looks like now:\n\n``` python\n        try:\n            self.spider = self._create_spider(*args, **kwargs)\n            self.engine = self._create_engine()\n            self.addons.check_configuration(self)\n            start_requests = iter(self.spider.start_requests())\n            yield self.engine.open_spider(self.spider, start_requests)\n            yield defer.maybeDeferred(self.engine.start)\n        except Exception:\n            self.crawling = False\n            if self.engine is not None:\n                if self.engine.spider is not None:\n                    self.engine.close_spider(self.spider)\n                else:\n                    self.engine.downloader.close()\n            raise\n```\n\nBoth tests pass with this, but I think there are some issues . First, the `except` clause shouldn't have to figure out in which line the error occured. This is probably better (exception handling) style but quite ugly:\n\n``` python\n        try:\n            self.spider = self._create_spider(*args, **kwargs)\n            self.engine = self._create_engine()\n            try:\n                self.addons.check_configuration(self)\n                start_requests = iter(self.spider.start_requests())\n                yield self.engine.open_spider(self.spider, start_requests)\n            except Exception:\n                self.engine.downloader.close()\n                raise\n            try:\n                yield defer.maybeDeferred(self.engine.start)\n            except Exception:\n                self.engine.close_spider(self.spider)\n                raise\n        except Exception:\n            self.crawling = False\n            raise\n```\n\nMaybe `ExecutionEngine` could get a new `close()` method that does the logic and decides whether it needs to stop the engine, close the spider, or close the downloader (or the `stop()` method could be updated)?\nThen, there's the test itself. It should test behaviour and not implementation: I don't really care whether `Downloader.close()` was called, I just want to know whether the reactor is clean. But the downloader doesn't have a `status` attribute or something. I could check whether the `Downloader._slot_gc_loop` was stopped, but again that would check implementation not behaviour.\n\nMaybe it's best to remove the `Downloader.close()` mock and rely on `twisted.trial` to check whether the reactor is clean after the error shutdown?\n",

          "body": "Hey everyone, thanks again for the feedback (especially for the full review @curita :)), I really appreciate it. Here's my two cents on some of the design issues (once again, caution, wall of text):\n\n##### Add-on configuration entry point\n\nAfter I had to discuss the add-on management in a blog post a couple of days ago, I have backpedaled a little on my preference. `scrapy.cfg` is a place for those settings that are not necessarily bound to any particular project (if I have multiple projects I probably still want to upload them to the same `scrapyd` server). Add-on configuration _is_ (most commonly) bound to a project, much like other crawling settings, and I agree that it should therefore live inside the project. If we don't want to introduce a new settings file (which I think would be a bad idea), that leaves us with the project settings module.\n\nI see two possible syntaxes for this:\n1. Each add-on has its own variable, like it is implemented right now, and is _not_ exposed into the global settings:\n   \n   ``` python\n   addon_MYPIPELINE = dict(\n       _name = 'path.to.mypipeline',\n       user = 'blah',\n       ...)\n   addon_MYEXT = dict(...)\n   ```\n2. There is an `ADDONS` dictionary setting that lives among all other global settings:\n   \n   ``` python\n   ADDONS = {\n       'path.to.mypipeline': {\n           'user': 'blah',\n           ...\n       },\n       'path.to.myext': {...},\n   }\n   \n   # or\n   \n   ADDONS = {\n       'path.to.mypipeline': dict(\n           user = 'blah',\n           ...\n       ),\n       'path.to.myext': dict(...),\n   }\n   ```\n\nThe first approach does not mix settings and add-ons, following the 'add-ons are one level above settings' philosophy I had in mind earlier. However the syntax is not very user-friendly, particularly having to use the `_name` key. The second approach puts add-ons onto the same level as the settings they are intended to fiddle with. I don't see an immediate drawback of this, but it strucks me as odd design. I also find the nested dictionaries, like these used for `logging.config.dictConfig()`, a little tedious. The user experience would be much more cumbersome than what we had initially hoped for. The big big plus is that it would integrate really well with custom Spider settings.\n\nNow the user _might_ want to enable an add-on system-wide, and I think we could keep the support for `scrapy.cfg` add-on configuration for this use case only. However, the docs should emphasise that this configuration does not belong to a project, and is therefore not deployed.\n\n##### Add-ons without a project\n\nI agree that there should be a way to enable and configure add-ons for stand-alone spiders. That would be no problem at all when using syntax 2 from above, so I guess that is what it will boil down to. We could keep syntax 1 if we introduced some new mechanism to enable/configure add-ons from within a spider, but that seems unnecessarily confusing. And frankly, I think syntax 1 is just as ugly, if not a little more, as syntax 2. ;D\n\n##### Local configuration\n\nFirst I want to point out that the (local) add-on configuration is not inaccessible for other add-ons or components. All add-on configurations are available to all components via the `crawler.addons.configs` dictionary. They just no longer clog up the global settings namespace. That being said, for backwards compatibility we should definitely keep the global settings for all builtin components. The idea I have for the builtin add-ons right now is that they simply take their configuration and expose it into the global settings namespace, much like [in `scrapy.addons.Addon.update_settings()`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-3e1ec9ad5dd8cd07504c3d6763322dbdR24). The components themselves won't be touched at all. This would allow users to configure built-in add-ons/component through both the new (add-on config) and old (settings module) way, and keep overwriting component configuration ad-hoc via Spider settings or the command line possible.\n\n##### Add-on callback placement\n\n> Related with what I mentioned before, if we loose settings locality, is it required to instantiate the addons so early in the loading process? Could update_settings() and check_configuration() be class methods?\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean, aren't the callbacks already class methods in the common use case (i.e. when the add-on interface is provided by a class instance, such as in the `scrapy.addons.Addon` class)? I have used the call to `Spider.update_settings()` as orientation where the add-on callbacks should be placed. An add-on might want to replace the stats class, so I guess one line below where it is right now is where we should call them at latest. Then again, I just realised there's already some settings that cannot be changed in add-ons right now, like the spider loader class. I'm curious what you had in mind?\n\n##### Add-on interface\n\n+1 for dropping the requirement of `check_configuration()`, it is indeed very conceivable that many add-ons won't want to use this callback.\n\nI like the additional attributes for further describing the add-on, and reusing `setuptools`/`distutils`/`packaging` etc., in particular for replacing the clumpy version check function I coded (I wasn't finished, I swear ;), but of course I could've figured that there's got to be a much better implementation ready out there).\n\nAs to the additional field for load order, i'm not really sure if that really helps us. Opposed to the current implementation of component orders, the user would have no (easy) influence on the add-on load order. That means there needs to be some kind of communication between devs, or a guide with recommended load order numbers for different use cases. While that might be doable, it seems to me that this will become hard to maintain if full-blown dependency management is introduced at some point.\n\n##### Add-ons configuring other add-ons\n\nI'm just keeping this in here as a reminder to myself to think about it. As I outlined earlier, I think as soon as the first `update_settings()` callback is touched, depending on whether we want to introduce the load order attribute, add-on configuration should be fixed. This only leaves the option of introducing a third (optional) callback, `configure_addons()`, that is called before `update_settings()`.\n",

          "body": "7eb837d is a rough version of my idea for the builtin add-ons, and it'd be cool to know if this is in line with the maintainer's ideas before I start writing tests and documentation.\n\nIn principal, the add-ons don't do much. All they do is act as a gateway to the 'traditional' settings. Neither the components nor Scrapy's default settings have been touched, so configuring components via the old way still works as expected. Additionally, it allows changing the settings via the add-on mechanism. That is, if I want to enable and the configure the http cache middleware, instead of adding this to my `settings.py`:\n\n``` python\nHTTPCACHE_ENABLED = True\nHTTPCACHE_EXPIRATION_SECS = 60\nHTTPCACHE_IGNORE_HTTP_CODES = [500, 503]\n```\n\nI can now alternatively use this in my `scrapy.cfg` (or the equivalent in the `ADDONS` setting as outlined in the comments above):\n\n``` ini\n[addon:httpcache]\nexpiration_secs = 60\nignore_http_codes = 500,503\n; enabled is already implicitly set through the existence of this section\n```\n\nI think this is close to the idea of the original [SEP-021](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/sep/sep-021.rst), with the addition that each add-on has its own section.\n\nIf there ever comes a new milestone release where backwards-incompatible cleanup is encouraged, the add-on configuration could be removed from the global settings and live within the add-ons/components instead, making them fully independent of any Scrapy/settings ecosystem. Components with interdependencies could still expose _some_ settings into the global settings namespace, or access other add-ons settings through the add-on manager. Or, as they are interdependent anyways, they could be configured through the same add-on.\n",

          "body": "Sorry I took so long to reply, I'm still unsure on the alternatives for the add-ons configuration in `settings.py`, but I'll comment some thoughts I have about this matter. Most of them are things you already said but I wanted to write them to get my head around this.\n\n**Add-on configuration entry point**\nI agree that it seems an odd design decision having the add-ons config in the settings file, but it definitely simplifies things. Out of both presented options, the `ADDONS` variable seems the more flexible one. I'm not crazy about it but I don't mind configuring add-ons this way in `settings.py`, django uses this approach with multiple nested dicts a lot.\n\nWhat I'm unsure of is that I think we're overcomplicating how current components are configured. We would be changing these:\n\n``` bash\nscrapy crawl myspider -s HTTPCACHE_EXPIRATION_SECS=60\n```\n\n``` python\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = 'myspider'\n    custom_settings = {\n        HTTPCACHE_EXPIRATION_SECS=60,\n    }\n```\n\nto these:\n\n``` bash\nscrapy crawl myspider -s ADDONS={'httcache':{'expiration_secs': 60}}\n```\n\n``` python\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = 'myspider'\n    custom_settings = {\n        'ADDONS': {\n            'httpcache': {\n                'expiration_secs: 60,\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nand I think that's sort of an usability step back.\n\nI wouldn't mind doing this in external components that I probably won't be configuring too often, but for builtin components I'm not so sure, this could become too tedious too soon. I know we're still supporting the current global settings, but if we're going to favor a single config entry point that one should be as carefully considered as possible.\n\nFor this reason I started to prefer your first design option since it looses the furthermost enclosing dictionary, but a) the add-ons configurations should be loaded with the other settings so they can be configured using commandline and `custom_settings`, though I think adding them as `ADDONS_*` isn't much of a problem besides cluttering a little the settings, and b) the `ADDONS_` prefix isn't really much of a difference from the other approach, it's a workaround for defining a namespace.\n\nSo, I dislike a little having to explicitly tell you're configuring an add-on if that can be deduced some other way. A third option could be to copy some other functionality from django here (I wonder how many times that has been said in scrapy's history :smile:), I'm thinking something like:\n\n``` python\nINSTALLED_ADDONS = (\n    'scrapy.addons.builtins.depth',  # or 'depth' maybe\n    'scrapy.addons.builtins.httperror',\n    ... # all builtins, this could be added to the settings.py template\n    'path.to.mypipeline',\n)\n\nMYPIPELINE = { # uppercased add-on name\n    'user': 'blah',\n    ...\n)\n```\n\nNot sure if possible though, but I kind of like copying the INSTALLED_APPS django setting, and the separated add-on config looks a lot like current settings:\n\n``` python\nHTTPCACHE = {\n    'enabled': True,\n    'expiration_secs': 60,\n    'ignore_http_codes': [500, 503],\n}\n```\n\n**Add-on callback placement**\nDon't mind the comment I made before, forgot how `zope.interface.Interface` worked and thought it was limiting `update_settings` and `check_configuration` to be only instance methods. Then I thought about having the possibility to call those methods without instantiating the class (if those are `classmethod`s) but I don't see any advantage over instantiating it and calling them later. I like the current callback placement.\n\n**Builtin add-ons**\nI really like the overall implementation minus a detail: I pictured adding components to their related component-dict settings slightly differently. I was thinking add-ons managing a single component could have a `type` and `order` fields in the interface (maybe `order` can be a config too) that could be used for automatically inserting themselves (or their path) to the component-dict setting defined in `type`. \n\nI realize these builtin add-ons are sort of encapsulating the actual components, they have to add the components' paths to the settings and not themselves, but maybe the inserted path/obj could be parametrized for this particular case.\n",

Maybe all those try/excepts could be flattened by handling callbacks manually (i.e. without `inlineCallbacks`), adding the corresponding errbacks for exception handling to the deferreds, but I think your version is more readable. I like either updating the `engine.stop()` method or adding a new `engine.close()` too.\n\nFor monitoring pending calls, I like relying on `trial` to check whether the reactor is clean, seems simpler and I think I read this was a good practice in the twisted testing guidelines. `trial` probably calls [reactor.getDelayedCalls()](http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.html#getDelayedCalls) for this, maybe we could call it explicitly but I think leaving this to the testing suite is probably the best option.\n\nAbout `assertFailure`, we have tried to get rid of `trial` sometime in the past because it wasn't fully python3 compatible. Removing the `trial.TestCase` inheritance wasn't possible though because the pytest plugin we're using to mimic `trial` behavior doesn't work on `unittest.TestCase` classes. But seeing how we're already using `assertFailure` in other tests, and how we probably won't be changing that inheritance now I agree there isn't any problem using it.\n",

          "body": "A few small updates/thoughts:\n\nI opted for a new `ExecutionEngine.close()` method instead of updating the `stop()` method. The reason is that I didn't want to remove the `assert` statement made in `ExecutionEngine.stop()` (after all the whole idea was to clean up even if the engine wasn't running yet).\nCode: [`close()` method](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-960cf0590f97e813c9ec6b2b0f197a33R87) and [usage in `Crawler.crawl()`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-017ca5ab6671590721d197e95de3cea3L75)\nI've also cleaned up the [graceful shutdown test](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-ad82c3d0394ef19ca24ea9d022470bf7R232).\n\nI've enhanced [base `Addon` class](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-3e1ec9ad5dd8cd07504c3d6763322dbdR33): It is now much easier to configure single components through the `component`, `component_type`, and `component_key` attributes and the [`export_component` method](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-3e1ec9ad5dd8cd07504c3d6763322dbdR75). Thank you for the idea @curita, does that look somewhat like what you had in mind? I've also updated the [built-in add-ons](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-8d70f795b45293b4516d41d5aaa66897R42) to make use of that new feature, and they look much tidier now.\n\n@curita makes a very valid point with how the `ADDONS` dictionary is a usability stepback. I like the Django-like `INSTALLED_ADDONS` approach and have added a corresponding [method](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-3e1ec9ad5dd8cd07504c3d6763322dbdR330) and [test](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-6473f345dba5b625efc61b379f1d80ddR214) alongside the old methods. A few thoughts:\n- A stumbling block with this approach is that it's not possible to _append_, not overwrite, to the `INSTALLED_ADDONS` setting from the command line; not quite sure how to overcome that...\n- Similarly, we somehow need to communicate to users that they should use `append` in their Spider's `update_settings`\n- A way out of this could be to allow using both `ADDONS` and `INSTALLED_ADDONS`, however that would result in **three** entry points to the add-on framework. Not very streamlined :/\n\n@kmike mentioned in one of his first posts if it would be possible that Spiders also implement the add-on interface and have their methods called through the same code path. I very much like that idea but so far couldn't wrap my head around a couple of questions: Should we support `config` for spiders and what would it be? Should the Spider be added to the add-on manager? Or should the add-on manager `update_settings()` etc. method have an optional keyword argument where the Spider is passed to call its callbacks?\n\nNow that I've coded around the add-on manager quite a bit, I think @kmike was indeed right in that it's not very useful to save the `used_keys`, I think I'll drop them soon.\n\nI have refactored the [`check_dependency_clashes()` method](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1272/files#diff-3e1ec9ad5dd8cd07504c3d6763322dbdR392) so that it now uses `pkg_resources`. But I wonder if we can make even more use of that package?\n\nLast, I realise that this PR is getting very large (+2,000 lines, phew) and therefore hard to review. However I don't see how it could be split up into smaller chunks. Any ideas how I could make it more clearly laid out?\n",

Thank you for the idea @curita, does that look somewhat like what you had in mind?\n\nThat was pretty much what I had in mind :) Not sure if I'd have added the abbreviated versions of the `component_type`s though, they seem rather cryptic for the sake of saving keystrokes, I'd prefer users to stick with the fullnames. Maybe I'd have added the component `order` as a class attr to match both `component` and `component_key` placements (in addition of being a config option), but this isn't necessary, and it could be taken the wrong way by thinking the order can't be changed.\n\n> A stumbling block with this approach [INSTALLED_ADDONS] is that it's not possible to append, not overwrite, to the INSTALLED_ADDONS setting from the command line; not quite sure how to overcome that...\n\nThat's a prevailing problem with any list valued setting :( I think as long as we can enable or disable add-ons using their configs (not sure if this is true for all add-ons though, maybe we could support a general `enabled` config in AddonManager?) it isn't a big drawback to have a fixed INSTALLED_ADDONS in settings.py listing all add-ons used across the spiders in a project. This is far from ideal (dynamically adding/removing add-ons to the list will be hard) but I think it's a reasonable compromise.\n\n> @kmike mentioned in one of his first posts if it would be possible that Spiders also implement the add-on interface and have their methods called through the same code path.\n\nI don't recall right now any constrain on spiders being add-ons (hm, wait, calling the spider update_settings() at the same time as the other add-ons update_settings() couldn't conflict with the add-ons config? could a spider still disable another add-on this way?), but if there aren't any issues (f8cdf1a?) let's implement it :+1:\n\n> Should we support config for spiders and what would it be?\n\nIf possible, I'd like to see spider arguments mapped into the config. A neat side effect of this would be that spider arguments could be configured like any other regular setting.\n\n> Should the Spider be added to the add-on manager? Or should the add-on manager update_settings() etc. method have an optional keyword argument where the Spider is passed to call its callbacks?\n\nThe second option is the one you implemented in f8cdf1a right? I like it, I think this distinction should be helpful at some point.\n\n> I have refactored the check_dependency_clashes() method so that it now uses pkg_resources. But I wonder if we can make even more use of that package?\n\nNot sure myself, I thought we could have a custom Addon class for add-ons defined inside packages and get `version` and `requires` from that package using pkg_resources but I'm not sure if that's even something that should be done with it.\n\n> Last, I realise that this PR is getting very large (+2,000 lines, phew) and therefore hard to review. However I don't see how it could be split up into smaller chunks. Any ideas how I could make it more clearly laid out?\n\nCleaning up the commit history should be a must to get the pr fully reviewed once it's done, but I don't see how its readability could be improved any further. Your code is really well documented so don't mind its extension too much :)\n",

          "body": "> I think as long as we can enable or disable add-ons using their configs (not sure if this is true for all add-ons though, maybe we could support a general enabled config in AddonManager?)\n> \n> calling the spider update_settings() at the same time as the other add-ons update_settings() couldn't conflict with the add-ons config? could a spider still disable another add-on this way?\n\nI added the possibility to disable any add-on by setting its config `_enabled` setting to `False`, that should allow disabling add-ons both from the Spider's `update_addons()` method as well as from the command line.\n\nOnce again, since there is currently no guarantee in which order add-on callbacks are called, setting an add-ons `config['_enabled'] = False` from a second add-on may not prevent the first add-ons `update_addons()` method from being called. However, it just struck me that, should we settle for the `INSTALLED_ADDONS` list setting, the user now has the possibility to order add-ons, so maybe I could replace the `AddonManager._addons` dictionary with an ordered dictionary (also, `INSTALLED_ADDONS` could be a dictionary-like `{'addonpath': order}` setting instead of a list, just like the component settings. That would also resolve the \"not easy to append instead of overwrite\" problem).\n\nNote to self so I don't forget to remove some code later: 2039892 made the `_source` config superfluos\n",

      "body": "Expand settings priorities by assigning per-key priorities for the dict-like settings (e.g. `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES`), instead of just a single priority for the whole dictionary. This allows updating these settings from multiple locations without having to care (too much) about order. It is a prerequisite for the add-on system (#1272, #591).\n\nThere are two main updates:\n1. All default dictionary settings are promoted to the `BaseSettings` class (formerly `Settings`). They behave just like dictionaries, but honour per-key priorities when being written to.\n2. Since their rationale becomes obsolete with per-key priorities, all `X_BASE` settings are deprecated, with default entries now living in the `X` setting.\n\nAnd several smaller updates:\n1. `Settings` is a subclass of `BaseSettings`. It loads the default settings and promotes dictionaries within them to `BaseSettings` instances.\n2. `BaseSettings` has a complete dictionary-like interface.\n3. _All_ dictionary-like component/handler lists allow disabling components/handler by setting the value of a key/value pair to `None`. A new helper, `scrapy.util.without_none_values()` was introduced for this. This was previously not supported by `FEED_STORAGES`, `FEED_EXPORTERS`, and `DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS`.\n4. The `scrapy.util.build_component_list()` helper has been updated according to the deprecation of `_BASE` settings, as the `(base, custom)` call signature does not make much sense anymore. ~~It's still backwards-compatible.~~\n5. **`ITEM_PIPELINES` can no longer be provided as list**\n\nComes with many new/updated tests and documentation.\n",

          "body": "> Currently DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS is the only setting that does not use the dictionary values for ordering (but instead uses them to store the path of handler classes) and thus cannot use build_component_list(). However, this may change in the future, maybe most of the code from DownloadHandlers.__init__() should be outsourced into a new helper function (similar to build_component_list but without ordering) in scrapy.utils.conf?\n\nFEED_STORAGES and FEED_EXPORTERS are dictionaries with paths that don't use ordering too, and those should handle *_BASE settings (DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS is a dict as well, but it's used differently). I like the idea of outsourcing the common code from FEED_\\* and DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS loading and `build_component_list`, and it makes sense to do so in this pr. Particularly I'd like to see a single place handling the <prefix>_BASE setting loading and updating with <prefix> setting so we can deprecate it sometime in the future more easily. Another thing that's useful for is to ensure that all settings can be disabled by assigning them the value `None`. Right now I think both FEED_\\* settings don't support this for example (and they should).\n\n> @Curita I needed to merge master into this since automatic merging was no longer possible at some point. But now I have this huge commit in this PR. Do I wait until we're ready to merge this and then rebase before we do?\n\nDon't worry, just rebase `upstream/master` when you can (we'll definitely need that before merging but can be done at any time you want) and force push the new git history.\n",

          "body": "Thank you guys for the feedback!\n\nI now have:\n1. Disabled auto-promotion of dicts, only dicts from `default_settings` will now be promoted to `BaseSettings` instances\n2. Updated the `SettingsAttribute.priority` behaviour for SettingsAttributes that contain a `BaseSettings` instance. It now always reflects the maximum of:\n   - the highest priority in the `BaseSettings` instance\n   - the highest priority ever given to `SettingsAttribute.set()` (even when that priority is higher than anything in `BaseSettings`)\n3. Updated `BaseSettings.update()` so it can also deal with JSON-encoded strings, this solves [the issue raised by](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1149#discussion_r31134086) @nramirezuy and avoids downgrading `BaseSettings` to `dicts` (losing all per-key priorities) wherever possible\n4. ~~Deprecated `scrapy.utils.conf.build_component_list()` since the `(base, custom)` signature is no longer needed. I did not want to reuse the function name though since people might be using it in their extensions.~~\n5. ~~As replacement, introduced `scrapy.utils.conf.build_components()` that only takes a _single_ dict, removes all entries containing `None` as value, then builds the list or returns the dict, depending on the parameter `to_list=True`.~~\n6. ~~Removed all references to `_BASE` settings (and their merging with the non-`_BASE` setting) in the complete codebase, instead replacing it with calls to  the function `scrapy.utils.conf._get_composite_setting(settings, settingname)`. This function, and the calls to it, should only be in the code until we decide to finally remove all support for the `_BASE` settings. I guess this is not exactly what @Curita had hoped for, since we will still have to replace all calls to `_get_composite_setting()` when we remove `_BASE` support, and replace them with a simple `settings[settingname]`. But the alternative (that I could see) would have been to include `settings` in the signature of `build_components()`, which seemed not very modular.~~\n7. Enabled disabling items through setting their dict value to `None` for _all_ default dict settings (including the default request headers) by placing calls to `build_component_list()` and `remove_none_values()` where appropriate.\n\n**To do**:\n- ~~Update first post with summary of changes~~\n- Tests\n  - ~~Call `Settings.update()` with json string~~\n  - ~~`build_components()`~~\n  - ~~Updating default dicts from the command line~~\n- ~~Check PEP8 compliancy~~\n",

Still very open for feedback of course :) I've updated the first post as an overview if you haven't followed this PR.\n\n@Curita I made some changes to the `_map_keys()` function that lives inside of `build_component_list()` so that it honours per-key priorities. As giving both `base` and `custom` becomes deprecated with this PR though, and per-key priorities weren't available before anyways, maybe that's not necessary and just clutters up the code?\n",

I see that you have used `:inherited-members:` in the `CrawlerProcess` documentation. I have omitted that here because it would be quite a lot of duplication and the `BaseSettings` (+ methods) documentation is directly underneath the small paragraph for `Settings`. Another option might be to use `:inherited-members:` for `Settings` and _don't_ use `:members:` for `BaseSettings`?\n",

Except for `ITEM_PIPELINES` being no longer allowed to be a list, which was deprecated since `0.20`, there shouldn't be any backwards incompatibilities though. The `BaseSettings` behave just like `dict`s, and the `_BASE` settings still work (and throw a `ScrapyDeprecationWarning` if used).\n",

          "body": "Here's a proposed release note:\n\n```\nDictionary settings are no longer overridden\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWith this release, Scrapy's dictionary-like settings (e.g. ``ITEM_PIPELINES``,\nsee full list below) will receive per-key settings priorities (see\n:ref:`topics-api-settings`). Internally, this is achieved by promoting them to\n:class:`~scrapy.settings.BaseSettings` instances. Instances of this class behave\njust like dictionaries, with one notable exception: When being written to, the \n:class:`~scrapy.settings.BaseSettings` instance is *updated*, not overwritten::\n\n    >>> settings.set('ITEM_PIPELINES', {'path.one': 100})\n    >>> settings.set('ITEM_PIPELINES', {'path.two': 200})\n    >>> print dict(settings['ITEM_PIPELINES'])\n    {'path.two': 200, 'path.one': 100}\n\nThis facilitates easy enabling, disabling, or configuring of single components.\nE.g., if you want to disable the pipeline ``some.pipeline`` from the command\nline, it is now sufficient to set the dictionary value for just this pipeline to\n``None``::\n\n    scrapy crawl example.com -s ITEM_PIPELINES={\"some.pipeline\": null}\n\ninstead of having to provide the full dictionary of all other enabled pipelines.\n\nThis update applies to all dictionary-like settings that have a default value,\nnamely:\n\n* :setting:`DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS`,\n* :setting:`DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS`,\n* :setting:`DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES`,\n* :setting:`EXTENSIONS`,\n* :setting:`FEED_STORAGES`,\n* :setting:`FEED_EXPORTERS`,\n* :setting:`ITEM_PIPELINES`,\n* :setting:`SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES`, and\n* :setting:`SPIDER_CONTRACTS`.\n\nIf your code relies on completely replacing, not updating, one of these\nsettings, you can work around the new behaviour by deleting the dictionary-like\nsetting before writing to it::\n\n    >>> del settings['SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES']\n    >>> settings.set('SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES', {'my.middleware': 100})\n    >>> print dict(settings['SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES'])\n    {'my.middleware': 100}\n\nHowever, keep in mind that Scrapy's standard procedure to disable components\nfrom the dictionary-like settings is to set their value to ``None``.\n\n\nDeprecation of ``_BASE`` settings\n---------------------------------\n\nThe new update-not-overwrite behaviour of Scrapy's dictionary settings (see\nabove) renders the ``_BASE`` settings that were previously used to store\nScrapy's defaults (e.g. `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE`) obsolete.\nConsequentially, Scrapy's defaults have been moved into the regular settings\n(e.g. :setting:`DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES`).\n\nWhile setting the ``XY_BASE`` setting will still work, please update your code\nto override (i.e. update) the ``XY`` setting instead, and set the value of the\ndefault components that you wish to disable to ``None``.\n```\n",

          "body": "Rebased onto current master and updated the function that handles backwards-compatibility for users who explicitly set `_BASE` settings:\n\nThey will now find the expected behaviour that they get _none_ of Scrapy's defaults for each setting where they manually have set a `_BASE` setting. E.g. doing this:\n\n```\n# settings.py\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE = {}\n```\n\nwill now result in no downloader middlewares being enabled (and a warning that `_BASE` settings are deprecated).\n\nNot sure about the codecov test failing. It says only 95 % of this diff are hit because there are a couple of places that weren't covered before but where I switched the syntax to use the new helpers, e.g. like this:\n\n``` python\n-            valid_output_formats = (\n-                list(self.settings.getdict('FEED_EXPORTERS').keys()) +\n-                list(self.settings.getdict('FEED_EXPORTERS_BASE').keys())\n-            )\n+            feed_exporters = without_none_values(self.settings._getcomposite('FEED_EXPORTERS'))\n+            valid_output_formats = feed_exporters.keys()\n```\n\nThese should definitely be covered but I don't think it belongs into this PR.\n",

It respects rate and concurrency limits because only the scheduler `next_request` part with adding new queue is updated.\r\nThe main idea here is to have a separate queue where is possible to manage requests with delays (if this parameter is added). This allows to not update and to respects the single reponsobility principle in the current queues.\r\n\r\nThis new priority queue has the similar implementation as default `ScrapyPriorityQueue`, but it uses timestamps as priority. It allows to easily add per request delays and doesn't touch the default queue. If this priority queue doesn't contain any requests to process or the current time is less than the next time when request should be processed it returns None and request from the main priority queue will be taken or it will go as usual flow.\r\n\r\nI've added a few tests to be sure that it works as intended. With this tests we can see so far that shceduler processes requests from the new queue at the right time, at other time it respects the order of basic priority queue.\r\nBut if this changes look promising not only for me I can add more tests to be sure that everything is ok.\r\n\r\nI've added a test dependency `freezegun` it allows to easily play with the time. I'm not aware about the policy of adding new dependencies, so if it not acceptable please tell, I will try to find some alternative way to test this timing tests.\r\n\r\nBriefly, this changes allow:\r\n\r\n1. process a request no sooner than X seconds from now;\r\n2. respect rate and concurrency limits\r\n3. avoid of updating all queues to have delays support;\r\n4. have a way for scheduler/queue to say \"I have some requests, so don't stop the spider, but I won't give you anything now\".\r\n\r\nAlso closes #3835 and closes #4980.",

The problem which you described is possible in case when we have a lot of requests with the same priority (incl. delayed request). If delayed requests has a higher priority then with high percentage it will be picked first from the standart queue. So if we want that delayed request will be processed first (once time comes) with delaying we can increase the priority of delayed request.\r\n\r\nThe second approach doesn't resolve problem with requests which have the similar priority, is the delayed request has more priority in that case?\r\n\r\nI think the first approach respects more the standart queue, the second - less",

          "body": "Hi @Gallaecio @WinterComes, do any of you have any updates on an ETA for this feature? It seems the discussion has cooled a bit, but the feature was ready for prime time (or almost there). Are there plans to finish the implementation?\r\n\r\nIn our case, we want to control the total scrape time a bit better (for a spider that only crawls the start requests but hits an API that might recognize the high load and take countermeasures, so we want to enqueue them \"every ~10 minutes\" from when we `yield` the `Request`s). I recognize this isn't exactly what Scrapy was designed for, but we're using it for other spiders and it's just this one that needs this behavior. We can make do with per-domain (i.e., per slot, probably as @Gallaecio suggested [here](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/802#issuecomment-680049056)) delays or even with `DOWNLOAD_DELAY`s and randomization, but it'd be better to have better fine-grained control (though in our case we don't even need to guarantee the delay is followed to a tee).\r\n\r\nEdit: I'd love to help here, but I'm unfortunately not familiar enough with `async` programming, twisted or scrapy internals to contribute to the PR.",

There are several libraries available to achieve this: **BeautifulSoup**,  **lxml**.\nAnd although scrapy selectors are built over the lxml library, it is a better way to extract data from HTML source. In my opinion, people will prefer **selector** to **BeautifulSoup** and  **lxml** , if make the scrapy.selectors into a separate project, \n",

See also https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/395#issuecomment-25055026. Selector can already be used without the rest of scrapy: `Selector(text=html)`, but I like an idea of making the separation cleaner if it is possible. To move forward this needs a more detailed discussion/proposal, +1s from other Scrapy commiters and a person who will actually implement it :)\n",

I made some tests and It is working fine locally. I completely removed response caching from LxmlDocument in hope to implement it at Scrapy side.\n- Second part is replacing Scrapy selectors with new library\n  Here I need to dig how to use new selectors with response object efficiently having same kind of caching.\n",

Could it be because, pypy tests are consuming a lot of resources? But they are happening because of my changes otherwise in other PRs they are not failing.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, `ResourceWarnings` can easily happen during tests. In that test, it may be that both warnings are happening, but since you are only checking the first, which is `ResourceWarnings`, the test fails.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a way to avoid the resource warning altogether. You could try and log the warning message, and see if it makes any sense. Those warnings usually happens because of unclosed files, which can be OK in CPython thanks to reference counting but PyPy has no reference counting.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot figure out how to fix the root issue, and I strongly suggest you do _not_ spend too much time on it, you could instead change the expectations, so that instead of checking that the first warning is as expected, you just check that one of the warning is as expected.\r\n\r\n",

I think it makes sense to allow users to pass already parsed data to the processor in order to avoid this extra work.\n\nThere are some edge cases though: e.g. if user pre-parses JSON string, and it doesn't have a top-level object (the result of decoding is a string), then JmesProcessor will try to parse the string again as JSON, which is wrong.\n",

          "body": "@nramirezuy still, the input was a valid JSON data which happen not to contain the value we requested. It is similar to asking for `foo.bar` when there is no 'foo' key in a JSON object - you expect 'foo' to be a dictionary with 'bar' key, when it is not the case. But the first query will raise a JSON parsing error, and the second will return None. And if a decoded string happen to contain valid JSON then the answer in first case would be just wrong.\n\nActually, I'm fine with leaving it as-is if this gotcha is documented. I agree that it is not a common case, and I don't see a way to handle it without making the API worse. Maybe we can have an option in JmesProcessor `__init__` (not in `__call__` method) to turn off string auto-decoding.\n",

If it works then I think it worths documenting. An maybe splitting this micro-framework from the item loaders, if it is not only about item loaders.\n",

This would allow fingerprinter to access Scrapy settings, which would allow to implement e.g. a fingerprinter which reads SESSION_IDENTIFIERS option and removes them from the request GET arguments before taking a fingerprint. \r\n\r\nThere is no reason not to use create_instance for all extension points we provide :) It always comes up later that we'd like to add from_crawler support to some component.",

However, I don\u2019t think we need them in our use case, given Python dictionary key order is deterministic.\r\n\r\nI tested the performance change with the following code (not sure it\u2019s the right way to test it, though):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport timeit, random, warnings\r\nfrom scrapy import Request\r\nfrom scrapy.utils.request import request_fingerprint, fingerprint\r\n\r\ndef test_function(number, function, include_headers, keep_fragments):\r\n    for n in range(number):\r\n        fp = function(\r\n            Request(f'https://www.example.com/path{n}#{n}', headers={'foo': b'bar'}),\r\n            include_headers=include_headers,\r\n            keep_fragments=keep_fragments,\r\n        )\r\n\r\nnumber = 200\r\nfor include_headers in (None, ['foo']):\r\n    for keep_fragments in (False, True):\r\n        for function in (request_fingerprint, fingerprint):\r\n            with warnings.catch_warnings():\r\n                warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\r\n                time = timeit.timeit(\r\n                    \"test_function(number, function, include_headers, keep_fragments)\",\r\n                    setup=\"from __main__ import number, test_function, function, include_headers, keep_fragments\",\r\n                    number=number,\r\n                )\r\n                print(f'{function.__name__}(\u2026, include_headers={include_headers!r}, keep_fragments={keep_fragments!r}): {time}')\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy results were:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequest_fingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=None, keep_fragments=False): 2.381159642000057\r\nfingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=None, keep_fragments=False): 2.5310360370003764\r\nrequest_fingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=None, keep_fragments=True): 2.4641983989995424\r\nfingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=None, keep_fragments=True): 2.576165890000084\r\nrequest_fingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=['foo'], keep_fragments=False): 2.6181979390003107\r\nfingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=['foo'], keep_fragments=False): 2.7359517559998494\r\nrequest_fingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=['foo'], keep_fragments=True): 2.655461521999314\r\nfingerprint(\u2026, include_headers=['foo'], keep_fragments=True): 2.763577738999629\r\n```",

This allows opening the FTP connection only once at initialization and closing it when the spider is closed (This is different from `scrapy.extensions.feedexports` where the connection is opened and closed every time an item is exported).\r\n\r\nThere are two things I need feedback on them. First, if the username and password should be supplied in the `file_store` setting or have separated settings fields for them. Second thing if a more exception handling is needed when opening the connection.\r\n\r\nAfter resolving these things, will write tests and documentation :) \r\n\r\nCLOSES #3928 ",

What would you say if I modified this PR to make both outputs consistent in the following manner:\r\n* `indent = None`: \"most compact representation\", i.e. all items in the same line (same as the current behaviour for XML)\r\n* `indent <= 0`: each item on it's own line but no \"internal\" indent, square brackets on their own line for JSON (same as the current behaviour for JSON)\r\n* `indent > 0`: indent with the specified number\r\n\r\nThat would be a little deviation from the \"standard\" in the sense that `indent=0` would not imply newlines everywhere, but I believe it would be worth in this case.

With two options there'd be 3 string values for the first option, and an int value would be active only when mode is \"indent items\". So that's where weirdness comes from - instead of explicit 3 possible string values + a separate option for indentation there is a single option with 2 string values which also accepts int.\r\n\r\nFor me negative and None values instead of strings feels like we're using negative and None values to choose (1) mode; it doesn't seem right - first, we won't be able to add other modes (it is not extendable), and second, why use magic number constants instead of readable string constants?\r\n\r\nFor me strings + int sounds ok, but maybe two explicit options is better.",

This is already true with the current \"all items on one line\" XML (which is not really the case then).\r\n\r\n> Another difference is that in XML whitespaces and new lines between tags are significant \r\n\r\nOk. But I'm not sure it is a big problem for Scrapy's item exports and their consumers. I don't expect users/parsers of `items.xml` files to care about or choke on newlines between `<item></item>` tags. Again, this is debatable as with any format breaking change. Thoughts?\r\n",

See also Guido's opinion: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-August/055907.html. \n\nIt looks like `sel.xpath('//p/text()').extract(1)` would be less efficient than `sel.xpath('//p[2]/text()').extract_first()` unless we employ some trick.\n\n`sel.xpath('//p/text()').first()`: I'd expect it to return a selector, not a raw string value; `extract_first` wins again :)\n",

(It's similar to what [I'm currently using](https://gist.github.com/nyov/8768180).)\nBut after thinking this through, it's correct that xpath or css selectors can always be tuned to get the correct single item.\n\nSo +1 to @pablohoffman for `.extract1()` / `.re1()`. (How about an alias `.x()` / `.x1()` / `.r()` ?)\n\nAnd for returning a single index (or range) as a list, there is still list slicing syntax `.extract()[-1:]`.\n\n(edit)\nI would also add that `extract1` / `x1` looks better, as it may be referred to as \"extract first\" or \"extract one\"; because whether the return is a first/last/middle value is in the eye of the selector ;) But we know it'll always be a single value.\n",

To address #4916 and hopefully #4497, I went through and used pathlib whenever possible for interacting with the filesystem.\r\n\r\nFunctions around new pathlib usage have had type annotations added. This helped somewhat with getting the correctness right. I avoided changing public interfaces to accept or expose Paths if they didn't already.\r\n\r\nIn one of the test files, Path objects were previously tested using one test and all the other tests used strings. I reversed this so only one test is using strings because I changed the shared test code to use Paths.\r\n\r\nThe tests pass, at least on my Windows machine.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains no intentional changes to functionality.",

So messages sent from spider like `self.log('msg')` are going to be sent to correct destination file and wouldn't appear in other files. Basically because of [this line](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/log.py#L83). But if you use `log.msg()` - like it's usually done in middlewares, pipelines and many places in scrapy core - log observer wouldn't filter this message and it will appear in all log files. While this is not a big problems when you have single crawl per process, this causing troubles when multiple crawls are opened in a single process, and yes, this problem wasn't solved in ScrapyRT and I hope we can find some way to fix this behaviour during migration to python logging.\n\nWhat could possibly fix this is prohibiting `log.msg()` method and forcing everyone to use some kind of `crawler.log()` method everywhere - idea is to have reference to `crawler` object in every event dict - then messages related to different crawls can be 100% reliably sent to destinations without showing up in other places.\n\nAll above applies only to twisted logging. I haven't checked this PR yet - possibly it solves this issue? I'll try to read it carefully tomorrow.\n",

          "body": "@kmike, @chekunkov:\nOh, I think this is going to raise some doubts, routing all spider/crawler messages into a single logger (thus not supporting directly the redirection to different files in a per-spider basis) was a design decision, I'll try to explain why I think this is a better approach.\n\nFirst of all, Scrapy needs to log things before crawlers are instantiated. It also needs to log messages independently entirely from crawlers, for example, if `LOG_STDOUT` is set print messages will be redirected to the logging system, and those clearly won\u2019t have a Crawler attached to them. The same goes for messages logged outside Scrapy by other libraries, like Twisted.\n\nOn top of that, there are messages logged inside the crawler when you haven\u2019t a spider instance yet (all extension initialization happens before the spider is instantiated) so there are messages outside spiders too. \n\nBecause of that there are always going to be messages outside crawlers. By itself I think this is a deal breaker, we can\u2019t link every messages to a crawler or spider, and it\u2019s not clear what to do with those unlinked (which crawler is going to configure them? they are going to be present in crawler outputs, facing duplication?) and I think any decision here will be somehow arbitrary.\n\nAlso, we\u2019re switching to python logging, so discouraging the users to use it directly, forcing them to call Scrapy wrappers over it (like with a `crawler.log()` call) goes against one of the main ideas for this change.\n\nAnother problem is that there\u2019s no easy way around passing Crawler or Spider instances to the `extra` parameter in log messages, and then filtering them with custom logging.Filters per crawler/spider to get those messages issued by a specific crawler. This makes it hard to use the available tools for configuring logging with the standard lib, so we would discard a lot of benefits for this port. For example, logging.Handlers (which take care of redirecting log messages to different sources) can\u2019t be attached to filters, only loggers, logging.Formatters only attach to handlers, we can\u2019t attach filters to other filters (we\u2019re using filters in [scrapy.utils.log](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1060/files#diff-7386607e889af488be474e8932dc8febR17)), etc.\n\nThose issues could be bypassed by using different loggers per Crawler/Spider, but there isn't a convenient way to implement this. Loggers are referenced by their name, so we should have a unique string representation for every instance. I know that the Spider.name is the first thing that comes to mind, but this is just not robust enough. It could change at any time during the Spider execution. It could be defined in its __init__ call, not as class attribute, so we won\u2019t be able to log anything until then. And more importantly, we can actually run two spiders at the same time with the same name, so we won\u2019t be able to differentiate their loggers. I think we could use a hash or id of the instance as logger name, but this will make the log output non-deterministic, and loggers will be hard to reference manually.\n\nMessages attached to crawlers are still given an instance of them in their `extra` parameters so implementing something that redirects messages in a per-crawler basis is still possible, but I rather keep it outside Scrapy to maintain simplicity and consistency.\n",

          "body": "@Curita \n\nAs far as Scrapy is used to run one spider per process that's not a problem. But unfortunately Scrapy is used in other projects, like ScrapyRT, and by design ScrapyRT runs all crawls in one process. That wasn't my decision, it was discussed and agreed with @shaneaevans, reason for this is performance considerations. So, when you have multiple crawlers in a single process and logging is not designed provide you a way to filter messages related only to one particular crawl - messages from all crawls running at the same time would mix which makes logging unusable.\n\n> First of all, Scrapy needs to log things before crawlers are instantiated\n\nCan you provide an example? I think you mean logging that's coming from commands code. In my opinion it's perfectly fine that those log messages doesn't have crawler object in extra as it wasn't instantiated yet and there's no need to associate such messages with any crawler.\n\n>  if LOG_STDOUT is set print messages will be redirected to the logging system, and those clearly won\u2019t have a Crawler attached to them. The same goes for messages logged outside Scrapy by other libraries, like Twisted.\n\nthat's not a big deal as well, at least in context of ScrapyRT such messages will be filtered and no one will miss them if they wouldn't appear in crawl log files.\n\n> Loggers are referenced by their name, so we should have a unique string representation for every instance. I know that the Spider.name is the first thing that comes to mind, but this is just not robust enough. It could change at any time during the Spider execution. It could be defined in its **init** call, not as class attribute, so we won\u2019t be able to log anything until then. And more importantly, we can actually run two spiders at the same time with the same name, so we won\u2019t be able to differentiate their loggers.\n\nIn case of ScrapyRT one crawler creates exactly one spider like it expected by latest Scrapy version - crawler doesn't support having multiple Spider objects any more. So no, I'm not talking about one logger per spider object, I'm talking about one logger per crawler object. And what I expect from Scrapy logging is to be able to create filter which will take messages related only to one crawler object and then send them to log file (or use in any other way). All messages coming from one spider should be handled by crawler logger. Also crawler contains references to engine, scraper, downloader, middlewares, pipelines, extensions objects (as far as I know we don't have singletones there, different crawlers reference different objects) - all messages coming from those objects should also be handled by crawler logger.\n\nRegards possible name conventions and implementation - unfortunately have no brilliant ideas. Crawl logger should be descendant of 'scrapy', so it could be 'scrapy.crawler_{object_id}'. You said:\n\n> but this will make the log output non-deterministic, and loggers will be hard to reference manually.\n\nTo deal with this crawler object may have method which will return proper logger object and this way of obtaining logger should be used in _all_ pipelines, middlewares, pipelines, extensions, engine, scraper, schdeduler, downloader etc. And it's not clear what you mean by 'non-deterministic' - if loggers with have the same prefix that shouldn't cause problems.\n\n> Also, we\u2019re switching to python logging, so discouraging the users to use it directly, forcing them to call Scrapy wrappers over it (like with a crawler.log() call) goes against one of the main ideas for this change.\n\nYou say we want users to use it directly - so why `Spider.logger` was added? This goes against direct usage of logger, as direct usage would be defining logger like `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` at the top of spider module or during `__init__`.\n\nSwitching to python logging has much more other benefits then ability to get logger by using `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` - loggers hierarchy, configuration flexibility, all these facilities like Handlers, Filters, Formatters etc.\n\nTo summarize - I tried to show why proposed logging design is not perfect and how it will break depending projects. If we merge it like it is now - I have no good ideas how to support it in ScrapyRT. Bad ideas:\n\n1) log everything in a single file - I think this have no sense \n2) log messages if they have reference to crawler of spider object - logging will miss a lot of useful log messages \n3) disable logging completely - yeah, really who needs those log messages :) \n4) return to the implementation where each crawl is started in separate process <- @shaneaevans ?\n",

          "body": "Thanks @chekunkov for reviewing this!\n\nI think that keeping a single Scrapy root logger, and using filters to separate messages based in their crawler is the way to go (that\u2019s why I kept the \u2018crawler\u2019 key in all log messages\u2019 meta parameter actually), but I\u2019m hesitant of implementing those filters in Scrapy, since their usage is going to be really dependant of what the user or application wants to do with them. They can be implemented quite easily with the standard logging library outside Scrapy, and by doing that the users would hold entire control of what they want to filter and what they want to do with those filtered messages.\n\nBy any case, if we decide that we want to make that feature available in Scrapy I think we can implement it after merging this PR, since it should be something complementary that shouldn\u2019t change the current approach.\n\nSome notes:\n\n> In case of ScrapyRT one crawler creates exactly one spider like it expected by latest Scrapy version - crawler doesn't support having multiple Spider objects any more.\n\nIt can\u2019t have multiple spiders running at the same time, and it\u2019s attached to a single Spider class, but it can have different instances of that Spider class after each call of Crawler.crawl (though these calls should be sequential, can\u2019t be done in parallel).\n\n> You say we want users to use it directly - so why Spider.logger was added?\n\nSpider.logger was added as a convenient already created logger to avoid users the need of creating one themselves, and this attribute allows us to provide backward support for the old Spider.log method.

There could be log messages in the extension initializations without crawler.spider being set then (if some extension is not configured is going to log a 'Disabled <extension>' warning, for example). If 'spider' can have `None` as value when passing it to extra we could move crawler.spider assignment to the start of crawler.__init__() [[crawler.py#L29-L35](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/crawler.py#L29-L35)].\n\nAnother option to make extra parameters more uniform is to pass only 'crawler' to meta, and users could check if crawler.spider is set or not manually, or we could create a filter to populate 'spider' in extra, doing this check ourselves.\n",

It was a sideeffect with me fighting with the CSV writer.  \n\nI gave it one more try and made the CSV writer work without changing encoding line by line (although in my defence I got that approach from the csv manual page)\n\nAs for the `line_buffering` being on it does seem to be required since turning it off broke the test entirely. I would be happy to skip the TextIOWrapper altogether, but the only way to do that would be reopening the file again with the encoding parameter specified. And considering it's the file object that is being passed to the exporter, closing and reopening the file seems more like a hack\n",

          "body": "Hi \n@pablohoffman thanks for your awesome scrapy! \n\nI was looking for something similar, i think is a big lack that such a complete software is missing socks support. \n\nMy case is a bit different. I currently use a middleware to remotely request a proxy from a dispatcher server, then i assign the obtained proxy to the current request. Everything is working fine if they are http proxy, but I'm struggling to get the same behavior with socks.\n\nImagine i have a list of socks, and i want to use a random proxy per crawl. I didn't find a way to make this work with http-to-socks converters (polipo, privoxy, etc) and i thought i could write a customized server to handle that, maybe with special header to define to which sock to connect to..but I think is way too much complexity! \n\nHere is what i have for http proxies, and I would like to do something very similar for socks \n\n``` python\nimport base64, urllib2, json\n\nclass ProxyMiddleware(object):\n    # overwrite process request\n    proxyDispatcher = \"http://my.proxy.dispatcher/\"\n\n    def process_request(self, request, spider):\n        if spider.name == 'some-particular-spider':\n            if not spider.proxy:\n                response = urllib2.urlopen(self.proxyDispatcher)\n                try: \n                    spider.proxy = json.loads(response.read())\n                except: \n                    spider.proxy = False\n            if spider.proxy:\n                request.meta['proxy'] = \"http://%s\" % spider.proxy['host']\n                request.headers['Proxy-Authorization'] = 'Basic ' + base64.encodestring(spider.proxy['auth'])\n\n            return None\n```\n",

          "body": "This is somewhat complicated because Scrapy uses Twisted Agents in downloader, and Twisted doesn't have socks client. There is only socks4 server. I did some research about this and there is unfinished ticket for socks client: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3508 \n\nTo implement socks support for Scrapy we would have to either:\n1. use existing socks-twisted libraries that are not official part of Twisted this one here looks like best one around https://github.com/habnabit/txsocksx, but this looks like it's Python 2 only :/\n2. Contribute to Twisted and add support for socks client to Twisted. \n3. Write socks client for Scrapy ourselves. \n\nWhich option is best?\n",

          "body": "I would, but some extra research on google led me to a few options I'm going to try first.   I'm working on an automatic public proxy farm (not using Tor) which I hope will be useful to all scrapy enthusiasts, so I will likely release it to open source in lieu of bounty money regardless of whether or not socks5 gets officially implemented/supported.  I already have a nice prototype that's been running for over a year and collected well over 350K public proxies.  A significant portion of these are socks proxies and I've been using with my crawling infrastructure that was initially built on top of Perl.  I'm in the middle of converting everything to Python though because I just can't deal with Perl anymore and I have picked scrapy as my crawling framework.  I'm intending on releasing it primarily as a scrapy middleware but I also designed it with modularity in mind so that it should be able to be hooked into just about anything with few headaches.",

      "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nRecently a spider I made to crawl cragislist for rental listings broke. When I checked the logs, it turns out that all of my requests were hitting http 403 error codes. Of course, I assumed the issue would be from not setting proper headers and not using proxies etc, so I went ahead and added auto user-agent and header rotation as well as adding in proxy servers. None of this helped. In a last-ditch effort, I wrote a simple **GET** request using the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module. Well, somehow this default request ended up working on the same URLs with 200 status codes even though it's the same IP address without any proxy servers or user-agents configured.\r\n\r\nI don't understand exactly how the request is sent out by **Scrapy** vs **requests module**, but even when I configured both to share the exact same request headers, one returns 403 error while the other returns 200. It seems I'm also not the only one to experience this weird result based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65295966/craigslist-403-blocking-urlopen-but-not-requests-get) StackOverflow post.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set up a default Scrapy spider with only default settings active.\r\n\r\n2. Install the latest version of requests and make a default GET request to any site using `request.get(\"any site\")`. Get the headers used by this default request. For me it was:\r\n```\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:8080\r\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.25.1\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nAccept: */*\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n```\r\n3. Configure the headers of the Scrapy spider request call to have the exact same headers from step 2.\r\n```python\r\n                scrapy.Request(\r\n                    url=\"any website\",\r\n                    callback=self.parse,\r\n                    headers={\r\n                        \"User-Agent\": \"python-requests/2.25.1\",\r\n                        \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip, deflate\",\r\n                        \"Accept\": \"*/*\",\r\n                        \"Connection\": \"keep-alive\"\r\n                        })\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Start a Netcat server locally to make sure Scrapy and requests will send the same request object. I started mine on port 8080 with the command `nc -l 8080`. Now change the request URLs for both Scrapy and requests to **\"http://localhost:8080\"**. Run both and examine the results.\r\n\r\nFor me, I see the following from Netcat for the request sent with **requests module**:\r\n```\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:8080\r\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.25.1\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nAccept: */*\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n```\r\nAnd I see the following from the **Scrapy Spider's request**:\r\n```\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.25.1\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nAccept: */*\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nAccept-Language: en\r\nHost: localhost:8080\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo they should be sending the same request object with the same info.\r\n\r\n5. Change the url from **\"http://localhost:8080\"** to **\"https://lasvegas.craigslist.org/d/apts-housing-for-rent/search/apa\"**. You should now see that for some reason the **requests module** request returns status code 200, while the **spider's** request returns 403 forbidden error. If you check the response body for the 403 code, you should see something along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n# these are custom formatted log outputs from me\r\n\r\n2021-01-08 20:26:02 [root] INFO: \r\n            Http error code 403 with response:\r\n            ----------------------------------\r\n            response headers: {b'Set-Cookie': [b'cl_b=4|5643cfbca785a2e77246555fdf34d45a3a666145|1610166362kVl2U;path=/;domain=.craigslist.org;expires=Fri, 01-Jan-2038 00:00:00 GMT'], b'Strict-Transport-Security': [b'max-age=63072000']}\r\n            ----------------------------------\r\n            original request headers: {b'User-Agent': [b'python-requests/2.25.1'], b'Accept-Encoding': [b'gzip, deflate'], b'Accept': [b'*/*'], b'Connection': [b'keep-alive'], b'Accept-Language': [b'en']}\r\n            ----------------------------------\r\n            body of response: This IP has been automatically blocked.\r\nIf you have questions, please email: blocks-b1607628794570390@craigslist.org\r\n\r\n            ----------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** When sending seemingly identical requests to the same URL from the same IP address between a Scrapy request vs request module request, I expected both to return the same result with the same HTTP status code.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The Scrapy request returns 403 forbidden while the requests module returns 200 OK.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% for me and another colleague in a different city and state.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nScrapy       : 2.1.0\r\nlxml         : 4.6.1.0\r\nlibxml2      : 2.9.10\r\ncssselect    : 1.1.0\r\nparsel       : 1.6.0\r\nw3lib        : 1.22.0\r\nTwisted      : 20.3.0\r\nPython       : 3.8.6 (default, Oct 10 2020, 07:54:55) - [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\r\npyOpenSSL    : 19.1.0 (OpenSSL 1.1.1h  22 Sep 2020)\r\ncryptography : 3.2.1\r\nPlatform     : Linux-5.8.0-7630-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.2.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI tried this with other sites and it works as intended. No difference between the two requests. However, for some reason, Craigslist is able to tell the two requests apart and identify one as coming from Scrapy, which automatically gets blocked.\r\n",

It fails with curl (command line, not the php stuff).\r\n\r\nI tried all of this together:\r\n* using exactly the same user agent\r\n* using exactly the same headers, in same order\r\n* tried all values for DOWNLOADER_CLIENT_TLS_METHOD\r\n* overloading start_requests() to perform requests.get(), checks it returns 200, and pass all relevant cookies to scrapy for next queries. There are indeed quite some related to cloudflare: `cftoken, cfid, __cflb`\r\n\r\nAnd all of that fails. The last one i really wonder why, but hey..\r\n\r\nMy (wild) guess is the following: there are only two remaining points on which cloudflare can base its accept/deny policy:\r\n* the order of headers, especially the \"Host\" one. You can't modify headers ordering precisely with scrapy.\r\n* case for headers. It's common knowledge that they are case-insensitive in specs, but cloudflare could very well don't care.\r\n\r\nI tried, but failed, to create a DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES that would use requests.get() to fetch the pages.

Finally, you can try to improve some docs or improve the tests coverage of certain parts of the code. All these actions would help you to start working on the project :smile: \r\n\r\nThank you again for your contribution!",

      "body": "This is long long-awaited by community(https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1802, https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2474 and https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3140) priority queue implementation for multi host case. Contrary to past proposals it is based on ~Downloader signals~ direct interaction with downloader, not on round-robin principle. Round-robin is much slower according to benchmarks. ~It became possible after new signal was added in https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3393~.\r\nIntention was to provide solution for this pain in shortest term as possible. So two problems left out of scope:\r\n- I didn't directly use https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3160 but take a lot of inspiration from it.  Thanks @tianhuil. https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3160 replaces priorities by hostnames as a slot for scheduling. As a result priorities of requests does not affect scheduling. I tried to merge priority and hostname to single structure. This structure is consumable by old downstream priority queue. As a result priorities affect scheduling. Both ways are not perfect. Perfect solution is to refactor current Scheduler structure.\r\n- This new priority queue is not set as default priority queue, because it does not support `CONCURRENCY_PER_IP` option. To enable such support we should resolve hostnames on adding them to queue. This is deferred operation and code calling to `Scheduler.enqueue_request` should be ready for this situation. This is not the case now.\r\n\r\nI run benchmarks using https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy-bench. In single host case(bookworm spider) new priority queue does not affect performance. In multi host case(broadworm spider) new priority queue improves it 10 times. Exact numbers available https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8iSzfmLuiG9O-mDgG4iDb4fGvAlnkC4sH_zr9Qlj-s/edit#gid=0, full logs are available https://gist.github.com/whalebot-helmsman/83ed45a1aa1b4221ab6be2f36226c5e3. Round robin based queue also does not affect single host case, but improves multi host one only 2-3x. That's why I remove round robin implementation.\r\n\r\nSettings used for bookworm https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy-bench/blob/f03011d63f4149eeaad6dd7908ffa6fcbbb3304e/books/books/settings.py\r\nSettings used for broadworm https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy-bench/blob/f03011d63f4149eeaad6dd7908ffa6fcbbb3304e/broad/broad/settings.py\r\n\r\nList of changes:\r\n- added tests for current priority queue\r\n- create priority queue in scheduler using `create_instance`\r\n- added `DOWNLOADER_SLOT` constant to Downloader\r\n- added wrapper for `queuelib.PriorityQueue` to handle merged priorities\r\n- added DownloaderAwarePriorityQueue implementation\r\n- added tests for DownloaderAwarePriorityQueue \r\n- ~added `request_left_downloader` signal as `response_downloaded` sent only in case of successful download~",

I think this might be easier then setting environment variables when deploying.\r\n\r\nThe list of ToDos, besides your thoughts are:\r\n* [x] Add documentation\r\n* [x] Add `gcs` schema\r\n* [x] Add bucket policy options\r\n\r\nPlease note that I worked with unit tests here, but I'm open to idea of integration tests. Do you have any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time to review this PR :smile: \r\n\r\n(edit) Closes #685",

One suitable way would be to encode them using Base64 or any other hash algorithm and defining the value in Scrapy Cloud. We would need to write the decoded Base64 value into a file and define the environment variable with its location during runtime. This would avoid having to version the credentials file.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

      "body": "Fixes #2142\r\n\r\nI've based the tests and implementation on https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/\r\n\r\nBy default, with this change, `RefererMiddleware` does not send a `Referer` header (referrer value):\r\n- when the source response is `file://` or `s3://`,\r\n- nor from `https://` response to an `http://` request.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does send a referrer value for any `https://` to another `https://` (as browsers do, [`\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"` being the default policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policy-no-referrer-when-downgrade))\r\nThis needs discussion.\r\n\r\nUser can change the policy per-request, using a new `referrer_policy` meta key, with values from \"no-referrer\" / \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" / \"same-origin\" / \"origin\" / \"origin-when-cross-origin\" / \"unsafe-url\".\r\n\r\n~~Still missing:~~\r\n- [x] Try to use `urlparse_cached()`\r\n- [x] Make default policy customizable through a `REFERER_DEFAULT_POLICY` setting\r\n- [x] Test custom policies\r\n- [x] Docs updates\r\n- [x] Add tests for policy given by response headers (`Referrer-Policy`) -- is this even used in practice by web servers?\r\n- [x] Handle referrers [during redirects](https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#set-requests-referrer-policy-on-redirect)\r\n\r\nTo handle redirects, I added a signal handler on `request_scheduled`. I did not find a way to test both redirect middleware and referer middleware (I did not search too much though).\r\nSuggestions to do that are welcome.\r\n",
